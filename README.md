# Leonland

This is the code for my personal website - [leon.land](https://leon.land). 

## Colophon and Credits

It's a simple site, but a lot went into it. It's generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using my own customizations to the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It began with the awesome [Create Static Site starter kit](https://github.com/forestryio/create-static-site) by [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/). The code lives here in GitHub, but the files for the website itself are hosted and deployed in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Shout out to [Harp JS](http://harpjs.com/), the static site generator I used previously, which made it really easy to learn how to build a static site.
