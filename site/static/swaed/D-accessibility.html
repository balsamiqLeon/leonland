<H1 class="style2">Appendix D - Accessibility Requirements</H1>




<H2 class="style2"><a name="D-1"></a>D-1  Considerations for Users With Disabilities</H2>


<P class="style2">Accessible design allows users with disabilities to use your product. In general,
  people with visual and motor limitations experience significant barriers with
  graphical user interfaces (GUIs) because they cannot see the content on the
  screen, or they cannot manipulate the mouse. Products collectively known as <I>assistive
  technologies</I> provide alternative control or presentation of the information
  (or both)
  with which users interact. For example, a screen reader presents
  the content of the user interface (UI) to blind users through speech synthesis,
  a refreshable Braille display, or both. </P>
<P class="style2">Broadly speaking, an application is <I>accessible</I> if its UI allows users
  to customize fonts and colors, and the UI can be controlled or presented (or
  both) by assistive technologies and a keyboard. For example, applications written
  with the Swing UI Toolkit are highly accessible because support for the 
  Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
  Accessibility API (<abbr>JAAPI</abbr>) is built into its user interface elements. Swing's
  UI elements have built-in hooks that allow a screen reader to query them through the JAAPI, 
  and then "read" each element's attributes to the blind user. For example, the hooks make it possible 
  for the user to determine what the name and state of the element with focus is. Similarly to 
  Swing, Web-based applications can utilize HTML's programmatic support for
  accessibility to enable their content to be accessibly presented through
  use of the user's
  browser and assistive technology.</P>
<P class="style2">Many users, both with and without disabilities, benefit from accessible design
  even in the absence of assistive technology. For example, applications that
  can be operated efficiently from the keyboard (using mnemonics, accelerators,
  and a logical tab sequence) benefit users who cannot manipulate a mouse.
  However, they also benefit any users who prefer to use the keyboard for speed.
  Furthermore, "having a disability" versus "not having a disability" is not
  a clear distinction. Many people have some temporary or permanent disability,
  such as repetitive stress injuries, suboptimal near vision, color blindness,
  and hearing deficits. All of these conditions are present in Sun's user population.
</P>
<P class="style2">Additional information can be found in <a href="01-introduction.html#1.4">1.4 Resources for Application Designers</a>.</P>
<H3 class="style2"><a name="D-1.1"></a>D-1.1 Government Requirements for Accessibility</H3>


<P class="style2">Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act mandates that all products used
  by U.S. government agencies must provide "comparable access" for
  people with disabilities. Virtually all Sun products are sold to the government,
  so all Sun products must meet Section 508 requirements to maintain and expand
  sales to this market. In addition to federal agencies, which are required to
  comply with Section 508 requirements, many state governments and large educational
  systems are complying voluntarily. </P>
<P class="style2">Because Section 508 requirements were designed to allow for progress in technology,
  the Final Rule listing of the requirements is not an unequivocal functional
  specification. There is no clear, complete, a priori definition of a GUI that
  meets the Section 508 standard. In addition to "comparable access," the Final
  Rule listing includes phrases such as "equivalent facilitation," "fundamental
  alteration," and "a range of contrast levels," all of which are subject to
  interpretation. Challenges to particular products, raised by affected individuals,
  will lead to clarification of the requirements, but only through the lengthy
  process of addressing such challenges and, potentially, through litigation.</P>


<H3 class="style2"><a name="D-1.2"></a>D-1.2 The Three Levels of Product Accessibility</H3>


<P class="style2">The level of accessibility provided by a product is determined by its 
  development team, as long as the final product meets the requirements
  of Section 508. In most cases, product support for accessibility can be
  fit into one of three levels.
</P>

<UL class="style2">
  <LI> Meet the minimum requirements of Section 508
  </LI>
  <P>Obeying the letter of Section 508 is required, but does not
    necessarily provide a satisfactory experience for the user. For example,
    an application with an inaccessible GUI can meet the
    requirements by providing a command-line interface (CLI)
    with equivalent or
    greater functionality. While a CLI may meet the letter of
    the law, it may be more difficult and time-consuming than
    the GUI. After all, efficiency of the user is the
    driving force behind graphical interfaces.
 </P>

  <LI> Design the application's GUI to meet Section 508's requirements.</LI>
  <P> This effort normally results in a better experience for users
    with disabilities. The improvement largely comes from all users having
    a common, sharable learning process
    and working experience. User Friendlier 508 (URL follows) identifies and discusses 
    requirements for a web application to achieve this level, along with
    helpful external references, including coding guidance.
    While a Section 508-ready GUI is a better level to aim for, it still
    doesn't guarantee an interface that is truly usable by people with
    disabilities.
  </P>
  <LI> Design the application's GUI to meet Section 508's requirements and this
    appendix's guidelines.</LI>
  <P> Whenever feasible, Sun's products should strive to maximize the efficiency
    of all users. This appendix is a companion piece to User Friendlier 508 and
    provides additional direction on how to make some common GUI elements delivered
    by a browser more accessible and usable to the user with a disability.</P>

</UL>
<H3 class="style2"><a name="D-1.3"></a>D-1.3 How These Guidelines Relate to W3C's Web Accessibility
  Initiative Guidelines</H3>


<P class="style2">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has spent many years devising a set of
  web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) as part of its Web Accessibility
  Initiative (WAI). They are available at <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html</A>. </P>

<P class="style2">The WCAG provides guidelines that are separated into three different priority
  levels. For the most part, Section 508 is a subset of WCAG's set of Priority
  1 accessibility guidelines. The WCAG is generally useful to turn to when the
  application provides a design challenge that isn't covered by this appendix
  or the User Friendlier 508 web site. Both the WAI guidelines and the 
  guidelines presented
  here are compatible with Section 508 requirements.</P>
<P class="style2">Here are some accessibility tips provided by the World Wide Web Consortium:
<ul class="style2">
  <li>Images and Animations: Use the HTML &quot;ALT&quot; attribute to describe the function of each visual element. </li>
  <li>Image Maps: use a client-side HTML &lt;MAP&gt; element and text for hot spots. </li>
  <li>Multimedia: Provide captions and transcripts for audio content and descriptions of video content. </li>
  <li>Hypertext Links: Use text that makes sense when read out of context. for example, avoid &quot;click here.&quot; </li>
  <li>Page Organization: Use headings, lists and a consistent structure. Use Cascading Style Sheets for layout and style where possible. </li>
  <li>Graphs and Charts: Summarize or use the HTML &quot;LONGDESC&quot; attribute. </li>
  <li>Scripts, Applets and Plug-ins: Provide alternative content in case active features are inaccessible or unsupported. </li>
  <li>Frames: Use NOFRAMES and meaningful tool tips (using the HTML &quot;TITLE&quot; attribute). </li>
  <li>Tables: Make line-by-line reading sensible. Summarize.</li>
  <li>Check Your Work: Validate. Use the tools, checklist and guidelines at <a href="http://www.w3.org/tr/wai-webcontent">www.w3.org/tr/wai-webcontent</a>.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<H2 class="style2"> <A name="D-2"></A>D-2 Page Elements</H2>

<H3 class="style2"> <A name="D-2.1"></A>D-2.1 Use the Most Appropriate HTML Structure</H3>
<p class="style2">It is important to use the HTML tags that most closely represent the desired
  structure of the page and that the tag structure be consistently used throughout
  the application. Assistive technologies use this information to determine how
  the web page should be presented to users. For example: </p>
<ul class="style2">
  <li> Use HTML heading elements (<span class="style6">&lt;H1&gt; - &lt;H5&gt;</span>)
    to signify the beginning of a new section.  Specifically, content page titles should use &lt;H1&gt;.</li>
  <p> Screen readers understand the purpose of this markup and know how to present
    the heading text in a way that notifies the users that a new section has
    begun. By contrast, section headings could be encoded with the <span class="style6">HTML &lt;FONT&gt;</span> and <span class="style6">&lt;BR&gt;</span> elements
    to visually represent the start of a new section however, because improper
    heading markup is used, the screen reader (and user) won't know if the text
    presented is regular text or heading text.</p>

  <li> Use the <span class="style6">HTML &lt;UL&gt;, &lt;OL&gt;</span>, and <span class="style6">&lt;LI&gt;</span> elements
    to encode lists.</li>


  <p> Screen readers know how to present list content properly when it sees these
    HTML elements. In contrast, the <span class="style6">HTML &lt;IMG&gt;, &lt;DIV&gt;</span>,
    and other elements could be used to visually present what looks like a list.
    However, as with the heading example, the screen reader won't have a programmatically
    obvious way of knowing when the content being viewed is part of a list.</p>
</ul>
<p class="style2">
These are just two possible examples highlighting the importance of using the
proper HTML elements when presenting structured content.
</p>
<H3 class="style2"> <A name="D-2.2"></A>D-2.2 Provide an Alternate Description for All Nontext Elements</H3>

<P class="style2">Examples of nontext elements include graphics, glyphs, illustrations, and
  pictures. Regardless of the type of nontext element, always assign an
  alternate
  description to it (HTML &quot;ALT&quot; text). Every nontext element needs some sort of 
  alternate description
   so that the vision-impaired user is able to tell if the information it conveys
  is important to understanding. Image elements that don't have an alternative
  description are particularly problematic for vision-impaired users. Their
  assistive technology, a screen reader, sees the image but can only announce
  that an unknown image exists. This does not help the user understand the
  content of the document.</P>
<P class="style2">Other guidance to follow for nontext elements is:</P>
<ul class="style2">
  <li> Set an empty description 
    <span class="style6">(HTML ALT="") </span>on nonessential nontext elements.</li>
  <p> A nonessential nontext element, if removed from the
    content, has no negative impact on the understandability of the rest of the
    content. One common example of a nonessential element is a bullet graphic
    that is used in conjunction with a list constructed using the <span class="style6">HTML &lt;UL&gt;, &lt;OL&gt;</span>,
    and <span class="style6">&lt;LI&gt; elements.</span></p>
</ul>
<UL class="style2">
  <LI>
    Provide enough information in the nontext element's 
    <SPAN class=style6>HTML &quot;ALT&quot;</SPAN> text so that
  the user knows what it conveys.</LI>
</UL>

<H3 class="style2"> <A name="D-2.3"></A>D-2.3 Associate Labels With the Page Elements They Name</H3>


<P class="style2">When a nonsighted or low vision user encounters a form element, he or 
she must
  be able to determine the purpose of the element. Form elements that
  don't include their own visual label attribute should provide a
  label by adding an HTML <SPAN class="style6">&lt;LABEL&gt;</SPAN> element.
  This visually ties the form element to its label but doesn't do the same programmatically.
  The result is that the sight-impaired user's assistive technology is unable to
  accurately determine which label is associated with a specific
element. The following guidelines
  demonstrate how to programmatically associate a label with a form element. </P>
<p class="style2">
<UL class="style2">
  <LI> Set the HTML &quot;FOR&quot; attribute on the <SPAN class="style6">HTML &lt;LABEL&gt;</span> element
    so that it ties the label to the form element it names.</LI>
  <P> More guidance and examples on how to accessibly code HTML form elements can
    be found at <A href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(n)">http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(n). </A>This
    guidance is compatible with that provided by the W3C.</P>
</UL>

<p class="style2">
<UL class="style2">
  <LI> Place labels on elements in consistent locations across the application's
    UIs.</LI>
  <P> A common guideline has been to place labels to the left of
    or above the element it is labeling. This guideline came about to help older
    screen magnifiers and screen readers that don't recognize the HTML "FOR" attribute
    on the HTML <SPAN class="style6">&lt;LABEL&gt;</SPAN> element. This layout helped the older technologies
    make more intelligent guesses on which label was naming a given form element.
    If this label orientation guideline doesn't fit with the
    desired look and feel of the application, ensure that the design requirement
    for the look and feel always calls for labels on element classes to be placed
    consistently in all views of the application.</P>
</UL>

<P class="style2">Content developers frequently group similar page elements together in visual
  groups. HTML 4.0 provides the elements that allow developers to do so
  in a programmatically accessible way. Follow these guidelines
  for grouping these elements together: </P>


<ul class="style2">
  <li> Group page elements together using the HTML <span class="style6">&lt;FIELDSET&gt;</span> element.</li>
  <p>Note that the default visual presentation of this element
    is to draw a box around all the elements in the the group. A style sheet
    can be used to prevent the drawing of the box.</p>
</ul>


<ul class="style2">
  <li> Label the group of page elements using the <span class="style6">HTML &lt;LEGEND&gt;</span> element.</li>
  <p> For usage examples for both these elements, go to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.10">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.10</a>.</p>
</ul>


<P class="style2">
<H3 class="style2">  <A name="D-2.4"></A>D-2.4 How to Encode Data Tables</H3>
<P class="style2">Tables can perform two functions in an HTML document: presenting data and
  specifying page layout. Both are encoded using the same HTML tags,
  but they have different
  purposes. Data tables (discussed here) define relationships between the elements
  they contain. In contrast, layout tables are used solely to arrange items on
  the screen. For information on layout tables, see <A href="D-accessibility.html#D-3.2">D-3.2
  Make it Easy to Discern Layout Tables From Data Tables</A>. </P>


<p class="style2">Follow these guidelines:
<ul class="style2">
  <li> Use the HTML &lt;TH&gt; element
    when the content in a cell is performing a row or column heading function.</li>


  <li> Use the HTML &lt;SCOPE&gt; element to enable
    the association of data cells with their headings.</li>


  <li> Use the HTML &lt;CAPTION&gt; element to
    visually label or caption a data table.</li>


  <li> Set the HTML &quot;TITLE&quot; attribute on tables
       that don't have a &lt;CAPTION&gt; element, to have tool tips</li>

  <li> Set the HTML &quot;SUMMARY&quot; attribute 
      on tables when the Tool Tip text 
      and the text surrounding the table don't
      provide enough information. The summary
      can be much longer than the caption or Tool Tip.</li>

</span>
<H3 class="style2"><A name="D-3.1"></A>D-3.1 General Layout Requirements</H3>

<P class="style2">The layout in a web application must be as consistent as possible from page
  to page. All users have a much easier time learning and using an application
  that has a consistent presentation, regardless of their experience or disability.  </P>
<P class="style2">

<H3 class="style2"><A name="D-3.2"></A>D-3.2 Make it Easy to Discern Layout Tables From Data Tables</H3>

<P class="style2">For information on the differences between data tables and layout tables,
  see <A href="D-accessibility.html#D-2.4">D-2.4 How to Encode Data Tables</A>. Follow these
  guidelines when layout tables are used in an application. </P>
<ul class="style2">
  <li> In tables used only for layout purposes, use only the following
    HTML markup:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> <span class="style6">&lt;TABLE&gt;</span> element.</li>
    <li> <span class="style6">&lt;TR&gt;</span> element.</li>
    <li> <span class="style6">&lt;TD&gt;</span> element.</li>
    <li> Set the <span class=style6>HTML &quot;TITLE&quot; </span> attribute to be empty (TITLE <span class=style6>=""</span>).</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Minimize the number of table cells in a layout table. </li>
  <li> Minimize the use of layout tables. </li>
  <li> Avoid nesting of tables within tables.</li>
</ul>

<P class="style2">To see the effects of layout tables, set their borders to 10 pixels. This
  useful test makes the layout tables visible, which simulates how they might
  appear to users of screen readers.</P>

<H3 class="style2"><A name="D-3.3"></A>D-3.3 Make the Function of a Frame's Content Clear</H3>

<P class="style2">Application views with multiple frames are defined using <SPAN class="style6">&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</SPAN> and
  related tags. Frames can successfully be used in a manner that meets
the requirements of Section 508, but some guidelines must be followed:
</P>
<UL class="style2">
  <LI> Set the HTML &quot;TITLE&quot; attribute on <B>all</B> frames, including invisible frames.</LI>
  <UL>
    
    <LI> Provide a meaningful name for frames with visible content.
    <P>
    The HTML &quot;TITLE&quot; of a frame should denote its purpose, and good examples of
    frame HTML &quot;TITLE&quot;s include "Table of Contents," "Main Content," and "Masthead
    Navigation."
    </P>
    </LI>

    <LI> For invisible frames, set the 
    <SPAN class=style6>HTML &quot;TITLE&quot;</SPAN> attribute to be empty 
    (<SPAN class=style6>TITLE=""</SPAN>).
    <P>
    Invisible frames are used for various reasons, such as polling a server without
    causing the entire browser to refresh. HTML &quot;TITLE&quot;s on these frames are important
    because users working with assistive technologies are likely to "see" each
    and every frame defined in the <SPAN class="style6">&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</SPAN>.
    </P>
    </LI>
  </UL>

  <LI> Enable frame content to be viewed without truncation when users select
    a large font size.</LI>
  <P> Generally, this guideline means allowing the scrolling or resizing of 
    the frame using
    the <SPAN class=style6>HTML &quot;SCROLLING</SPAN>&quot; attribute, and avoiding 
    the use of the 
    <SPAN class=style6>HTML &quot;NORESIZE&quot;</SPAN> attribute.
    Other issues to address with large text size are discussed in more detail
    in <A href="D-accessibility.html#D-4.3">D-4.3 Accommodate the Use of Larger Font Sizes</A>.</P>
</UL>
<UL class="style2">

  <LI> Framesets are not required to provide a <SPAN class="style6">&lt;NOFRAMES&gt;</SPAN>
    version.</LI>
  <P> The <SPAN class="style6">&lt;NOFRAMES&gt;</SPAN> element and approach
    was originally introduced to ensure users with browsers or assistive
    technologies that couldn't parse frames still had access to the content of
    all frames. Sun products don't need to provide the <SPAN class="style6">&lt;NOFRAMES&gt;</SPAN> approach. This is because
    the user audience for our products has browsers and assistive technologies
    that can parse frames.</P>

However, as with all accessibility checkers, it has its weaknesses. For example, analysis of JavaScript code is still rudimentary and a certain amount of human follow-up is often necessary to verify a potential problem. It cannot &quot;certify&quot; that a web application meets Section 508 requirements. These weaknesses exist in all web page accessibility checkers because accessibility, like usability, cannot be verified through a fully automated process.<br>
