<p>Tables are important constructs in Sun's browser-based applications.
  They are used not only to display object properties in a clean, readable format,
  but also to display object lists. Tables that display object lists enable users
  to select and then perform actions on one or more objects in the table. Each
  row in the table typically displays a few of the most important properties
  for a particular object. These properties, which often include the object
  name, object type, and object status, provide users with
  critical roll-up information. These tables may also allow the user to change
  the way a table is viewed by sorting or filtering the table content, or by changing
  certain table preferences (such as including, excluding, or even reordering columns). </p>
<p>Though tables are effective at displaying groups of objects, in certain circumstances, 
  you might choose a different user interface method. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a list of objects needs to be displayed without any object properties, 
    then a simple list or a selectable list box might be preferable. See 
    <a href="07-simple.html#7.2.1.4">7.2.1.4 Scrolling List</a> and <a href="07-simple.html#7.2.2.2">7.2.2.2 
    Multiple Selection Scrolling List</a>.
  <li>If objects in a list of objects fit into a natural, 
    principal hierarchy, a tree might be preferable. See <a href="05-navigation.html#5.4">5.4 
    Tree Details</a>.
  <li>If users require knowledge of how objects are interconnected in a network, 
    then a topological or graphical view might be preferable. See <a href="10-topology.html">Chapter 
    10, Topology</a>. 
</ul>
<h2><a name="9.1"></a>9.1 General Table Guidelines</h2>
<p>This section describes the basic characteristics of tables, including 
  their basic anatomy and their component parts. In addition, guidelines 
  explain how to display empty tables and empty table cells, and how to 
use tables to display properties.</p>
<h3><a name="9.1.1"></a>9.1.1 Basic Table Anatomy</h3>
<p>There are a variety of different tables, but they are all variants of two general
  types:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Property Table (typically including two data columns). See <a href="09-tables.html#9.1.5">9.1.5 Property 
  Table</a> for details:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    <img src="tables_graphics/properties.png" alt="Example of properties for a single object" width="783" height="201" border="1"> 
    <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  Listings of  objects (typically would be more than the two data columns shown here):<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <img height="272" src="tables_graphics/basic_table.gif" width="583" border="0" alt="Example of a simple multi-column table">  </p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>These two examples are very simple. However, many tables also contain elements
  that users can manipulate, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A column of checkboxes or radio buttons for selecting rows
  <li>Simple user interface elements for acting on selected items
  <li>Icons for selecting and deselecting all the displayed rows in a table
  <li>Simple user interface elements for sorting and filtering the content displayed
    in a table
  <li>Icons for custom filtering, multiple-column sorting, 
    table preferences, and vertical pagination 
</ul>
<p>A table with callouts to all of these features is shown below. Details are 
  discussed in the remaining sections of this chapter.</p>
<p><img height="438" src="tables_graphics/tablecallout.gif" width="844" alt="Example of a table, with calouts for all its parts"></p>
<p><b>A) 
  Table Title Bar<br>
  B) Action Bar (top)<br>
  C) Column Headings Bar, including sort controls <br>
  D) Left-Aligned Data<br>
  E) Right-Aligned Data<br>
F) Column Footers<br>
G) Action Bar (bottom)<br>
<b><b>H) Deselect Control (replaced with select all and deselect all controls for multiple selection tables)<br>
I) Table Actions (buttons and drop-down menu)<br>
J) View-Changing Controls (filter menu and icons)<br>
K) Separator Bar<br>
<b>L) Vertical Pagination Control<br>
</b></b></b>M) Selection Column<br>
  <b>N) Table Footer </b></b><br>
<b><b>O) Pagination Controls</b></b></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> When a lighter weight table is needed outside the portal, just use the standard table and leave off the action bar. Only use the portal light weight table inside portals. See <a href="08-complex.html#8.7.2">8.7.2 Portlet Table</a> for more information about portlet tables. <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="9.1.2"></a>9.1.2 Table Characteristics</h3>
<p>Tables organize data into a series of columns and rows. Each field in a table 
  is called a <i>cell</i>.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Tables 
  must have these elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A table title tag (needed for accessibility, is not visible).<br>
    <br>
    Usually tables have a visible title as well, but doing so is not required. If a table title is included, apply headline capitalization to it (see <a href="02-visual.html#2.5">2.5 Text Capitalization</a>). <br>  
  <li>For tables with actions, an action bar that includes table actions (buttons, 
    a drop-down menu, or both)&nbsp;as specified in <a href="09-tables.html#9.4">9.4 Table Actions</a>. <br>
    <br>
    The top action bar may also contain view-changing controls (a filter field, 
    icons, or both) and the Vertical Table Pagination control 
    if pagination is used, as specified in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.6">9.5.6 View-Changing Buttons</a>.<br>
  <li>Another action bar on the bottom if the table does 
    not typically fit on one screen (when using an 1024 x 768 resolution and standard 
    sized fonts). The bottom action bar includes the same table actions as in 
    the top table action bar.<br>
    <br>
    The bottom action bar may also contain pagination 
    controls. Since pagination controls are only used on large tables, there is 
    always a bottom action bar to show pagination controls when needed.<br>
  <li>A separator bar between major blocks of elements (table 
    actions, view-changing controls, and pagination controls) in the action 
    bars. <br>
  <li>A column headings bar. If table column headings are long, they can be broken 
    into multiple lines. Additionally, the user can perform simple sorting of 
    table content by interacting with the elements in the column headings bar 
  as specified in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.1">9.5.2.1 Direct Table Sorting</a>.
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Align 
  table columns and their column headings based on 
  the type of information they contain, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-align numerical information (monetary amounts, quantities, and so 
    on) to allow magnitude among values to be more easily compared. Numerical 
    information does not include character strings that happen to be numbers, 
    such as identification numbers. Floating point numbers 
    (i.e. money) must be formatted with fixed-decimal-digits to ensure this alignment.<br>
  &nbsp;  
  <li>Right-align dates, as that keeps them best aligned with each other, even 
    when leading zeros on months and days are suppressed.<br>
  <li>For most text strings, left-align the text. 
    Center-align the text for short keyword-like strings 
    like Yes/No (but see recommendation <a href="09-tables.html#later_in_this_section">later in this section beginning with &quot;When showing true/false&quot;</a>).<br>
  <li>Center-align fixed-length fields.<br>
  <li>Center-align graphics.<br>
  <li>Always align column headings the same way as the column contents.
    <br>  
  <li>Do not mix alignment in a column. If a column has mixed datatypes, then 
  always use left alignment.   
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;If a table cell includes an alarm, the alarm severity icon must be left-aligned and centered vertically. The alarm label (for example, "Critical") or the count of the number of those alarms must appear to its right. In addition, the background of the table cell must be highlighted as shown below. Here is an example:</p>
<p><strong><img src="tables_graphics/alarms.png" width="711" height="220"></strong></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Table 
  titles for tables which are currently paginated should be appended with the 
  range of items currently displayed and the total number of items in the table. 
  For example, &quot;(1 - 25 of 200)&quot;.  If 
  a table is not currently paginated, the title should instead be appended with 
  the number of displayed items. For example, &quot;(18)&quot;. Optionally, a 
  text description can be used after the number where needed for clarification, such 
  as &quot;Faults (1-25 of 100 alarms)&quot; or &quot;Faults (6 alarms)&quot;. Do not show this count for Property Tables, which are discussed in <a href="09-tables.html#9.1.5">9.1.5 Property Table</a></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;Avoid creating tables which have horizontal scrolling at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels with the standard 
font size as much as possible. Before having horizontal scrolling, consider if all the data shown is really needed (perhaps it could be shown in a detail page to which the user can drill down), or if column headers could be stacked two lines to reduce their width. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;All 
  tables must be set to 100 percent of the page width. Setting all tables to 100 
  percent ensures consistent right margins on the page.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;For tables whose data will fill only about half the width of the page (with typical data, at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels with the standard font size) add a blank filler column on the right so the data does not spread too far apart. This blank filler column on the right should not have a vertical line to the left of it and has no text in the column header. </p>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/SpacerColumn.gif" width="816" height="267"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Use
  hyperlinks for items in tables that need to link to other pages. See <a href="09-tables.html#9.2">9.2
  Embedded Table Navigation</a>.</p>
<p><a name="later_in_this_section"></a><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;When showing true/false or yes/no type values, use self-contained descriptive terms if at all possible. This allows the user to read and understand the value even if the column header is scrolled out of view. For example, Enabled/Disabled can be understood without the column header for context, while Yes/No, without being able to see an Enabled column header above it, is meaningless.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When the user selects one or more rows in the table, indicate those selections by highlighting the selected row(s).</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;If there is general information to show about the table, such as the date the data was last updated, etc., show that in the footer of the table. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;If a footer is used, center the text of the footer unless the table supports maintaining selections which are not displayed (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a> for more information). If non-displayed selections are maintained, place the general text left-aligned in the footer, to make room for the count of the Selections Not Displayed on the right of the footer. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;If 
  it is necessary to emphasize textual table data, use bold text. Use text bolding 
  judiciously so its use for emphasis is maintained. If many data values are bolded, 
  nothing will be emphasized. Also, do not use bold text for alarm conditions 
  because there are alarm icons for this purpose (see <a href="16-alarms-status.html">Chapter 16&nbsp;Alarms&nbsp;and&nbsp;Status&nbsp;Indicators</a>). One good example of this would be in a table showing firmware of various hardware systems, bolding the firmware which is not the most up to date. Here is a second example showing bolded 
  values where the percentage of space consumed exceeds a threshold and where 
  the amount of free space has fallen below a threshold: </p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> If there are 2 or more columns which form a subset group, or are variations on a type of value, they can be grouped together under a spanning column header like this:</p>

<h3><a name="9.1.3"></a>9.1.3 Displaying Empty Tables</h3>
<p>An empty table is a table that contains no items. </p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;To
  display an empty table, display its column headings and a single table data
  row. This row, which consists of one cell that spans all columns, should be
blank except for a left-aligned text message. The message will take one of two forms depending upon whether or not a filter is applied to the table:
<ul>
<li> If there is no filter applied to the table, include at least
  the following information, in the order listed:
  <ol>
  <li>Notification that the table is empty (required)
  <li>An explanation of why the table is empty (if known)
  <li>A description of how users can add an item to the table (if users can add
    items)
</ol>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Specifically,
  if the table is empty, display this message: &quot;No items found.&quot; Or,
  if the user can add items to the table, display this message: &quot;No items
  found. To add an item, &lt;perform-this-action&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p>Make the message as specific as possible. For example: &quot;No files to monitor were found. To add a file to monitor, &lt;perform-this-action&gt;.&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="9.1.5"></a>9.1.5 Property Table</h3>
<p> When displaying properties for a single object, a Property Table might be 
  useful. A Property Table typically includes two data columns. The first column 
  identifies the properties of the object, and the second column displays the 
  values for each of the properties. The remaining width of the table displays 
  a third, blank column to keep the first two columns next 
  to one another while still having the table fill the full screen width. 
Here is an example:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <img src="tables_graphics/properties.png" width="783" height="201" alt="Example property table"> 
  <br>
  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Use 
  these considerations to decide between using a Property Table and using a layout 
of simple fields as in <a href="06-content.html#6.9">6.9 Property Page Example</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always use a property page layout, not a property 
    table, if any of the fields can be edited (even if there are situations when 
    the fields may become temporarily read-only). In contrast, generally use a 
    property table if the data can never be edited (for example, it is not managed 
    by the application).</li>
  <li>Always use a property page layout, not a property 
    table, if any of the fields is something other than text (such as an image, 
    a text area, etc.)</li>
  <li>Generally use a property table if the set of properties 
    (not the values, but the properties themselves) which will be shown on that 
    page will differ from object to object, such as when the same table might 
    show the properties of any of a set of different objects. In contrast, generally 
    use a property page if the set of properties (not the values, but the properties 
    themselves) will remain the same for different items shown on that page.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Label 
  the first column heading of a Property Table "Property", and display the list 
  of object properties in this column. </p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Label 
  the second column heading of a Property Table "Value", and display each property's 
  value in this column. </p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;As with standard tables, for property tables whose data will fill only about half the width of the page (with typical data, at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels with the standard font size) add a blank filler column on the right so the data does not spread too far apart. This blank filler column on the right should not have a vertical line to the left of it, and has no text in the column header. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Do not include a row count in the table header of property tables. </p>
<h3><a name="9.1.6"></a>9.1.6 Table Interactive Example </h3>
<p>See the interactive example at <a href="http://webdev2.sun.com/example/faces/table/table.jsp">http://webdev2.sun.com/example/faces/table/table.jsp</a>, or for other permutations of the table, see the index at <a href="http://webdev2.sun.com/example/faces/table/index.jsp">http://webdev2.sun.com/example/faces/table/index.jsp</a></p>
<h2 ><a name="9.2"></a>9.2 Embedded Table Navigation</h2>
<p>One of the most common forms of navigation is the use of hyperlinks inside 
  a table. Typically, these links cause the current page to refresh with new content, 
  or they open a pop-up window. The hyperlinked text for each command should not 
  be underlined, except when the mouse is over it. This 
  is consistent with other hyperlinking within the content area. Many examples 
  of embedded table navigation are provided in these guidelines. Here is one example:</p>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/table_navigation.gif" alt="Example of embedded table navigation" height="302" width="610"></p>
<h2 ><a name="9.3"></a>9.3 Selection in Tables</h2>
<p>Table selection refers to the user's ability to identify one or more table
  rows for some purpose. Some tables allow for the selection of only one row
  at a time (single selection), while others allow for the selection of multiple
  rows (multiple selection). These guidelines explain how to design both types
  of selection in tables.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When a row is selected in a table, whether that table allows single selection or multiple selection (see below), the selected row(s) should be highlighted. </p>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">  When the table includes a selection column but there are rows which cannot be selected, or upon which no action can be taken, replace the radio button or checkbox with this dash image: <IMG src="tables_graphics/empty_table_cell.gif" width="13" height="13">with the tool tip: "Not Available". <br>
  <br>
This is a clearer and more consistent design than displaying disabled radio buttons or checkboxes for these rows, since a disabled item indicates it can be enabled through some user action. Also, simply not displaying the inapplicable user interface element can appear as if the page just did not paint correctly. </P>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Except for tables which allow non-displayed selections  (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a> for more information), object selection is not persistent across paginated (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.4">9.5.4 Vertical Pagination in Tables</a>) and sorted (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2">9.5.2 Table Sorting</a>) tables. In other words, the state of a selected item that is no longer visible as the result of a pagination, filtering, new row insertion, or a sort action changes to an unselected state.</P>
<h3 ><a name="9.3.1"></a>9.3.1 Single Selection in Tables</h3>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  only a single table row can be selected at a time, insert a column of radio
  buttons as the leftmost column in the table.</p>
<p><img height="228" alt="Example of a single selection table" src="tables_graphics/table_singleselect.gif" width="723" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;If
  appropriate, provide a default radio button selection when the table is first
  displayed. For the default selection, select either the first or the most appropriate
  item in the list of radio buttons. If no item is appropriate for default selection, 
  then provide no initial selection.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;If
  the table has no default radio button selection, consider providing a control
  to reset the selection to this initial state if doing so makes sense, given
  the use of the table. A &quot;reset&quot;&nbsp;iconic button can serve this
  purpose. Thus, if a radio button is selected, the user can deselect it by
  clicking this reset button.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp; If you use a reset button, place the button at the far left of the table's top action bar, as shown below.&nbsp;Insert a separator bar after it. </p>
<p><img height="153" alt="Single select call-out example" src="tables_graphics/deselect-radio.gif" width="42" border="0"></p>
<H3 ><a name="9.3.2"></a>9.3.2 Multiple Selection in Tables</H3>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  multiple rows can be selected at a time, insert a column of checkboxes as the
  leftmost column in the table.</p>
<p><img height="233" alt="Example of a multiple selection table" src="tables_graphics/tablescheckbox.gif" width="722" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" width="14" height="14">&nbsp;If 
  the table contains numerous rows, provide a Select All action to allow users
  to select all rows displayed in the table at once. Also provide a Deselect
  All action to allow users to deselect all displayed rows at once.</p>
<p>Users might want all rows selected, or they might want to select all rows
  as a first step in selecting most rows. In the latter case, users would then
  deselect those rows that should not be selected. The Deselect All action helps
  users who&nbsp;want to clear an existing selection before making a new selection.
  Provide these actions using iconic buttons within the table. The Select All
  button allows users to select all rows displayed in the table. The Deselect
  All button allows users to return all the checkboxes to their unselected state. (Consideration was given to using a checkbox on top of the column for select all and deselect all, as is seen other places, but the ability for the user to directly select all or directly deselect all, without them having to figure out to do the other action first, led to the decision to use the buttons instead.)</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  vertical pagination (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.4">9.5.4 Vertical Pagination in Tables</a>)
  is in use, the Select All and Deselect All buttons pertain only to the rows
  currently displayed in the table.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;If

<h2 ><a name="9.4"></a>9.4 Table Actions</h2>
<p>Most tables are interactive and allow users to modify them. Users can 
  select and act upon objects within a table. Users can also change the 
  appearance and organization of tables (dividing table contents into a 
  number of pages, for example) or the order in which table components
  appear (sort order). To perform table actions, users have a number of 
  tools, including buttons, drop-down menus, and column headers that 
implement sorting.</P>
<H3 ><A name="9.4.1"></A>9.4.1 Definition of Table Actions and Related Terms</H3>
<p>These guidelines support two kinds of local actions:</P>
<UL >
  <LI><I>Content page actions</I> refer to actions whose scope is the entire
    page. See <A href="06-content.html#6.5">6.5 Content Area Actions</A>.
  <LI><I>Table actions</I> refer to actions whose scope is limited to the objects
    inside the table.
</UL>
<p>There is an additional contrast between actions that affect objects inside
  a table and actions that <I>change how the content in a table is viewed</I>.
  Such "view-changing" actions define, for example, how the objects
  are arranged in the table (based on the sort order) or which objects are displayed
  in the table (based on the filter selected). For more information, see <A href="09-tables.html#9.5">9.5
  Changing Table Views</A>.</P>
<p>Some table actions require a selection, while others do not. Some table actions 
  allow multiple selections. Consider the following typical use of table actions 
  for a table that contains a list of servers. The table actions allow users to 
  add new servers, to delete existing servers, and to edit a server's properties. 
  These actions (New, Delete, and Edit) require different 
  types of object selection. The Delete and Edit actions require users to select 
  from the list of servers in the table. Though users can delete multiple servers 
  at once from the table, they can typically edit only one server at a time. In contrast, 
  users execute the New action without selecting 
  any items in the table.</P>
<p>Subsequent sections use these terms to differentiate these three types of
  object selection:</P>
<UL >
  <LI><span style="white-space: pre;"><i>No selection</i> (for example, as applies to a New action)</span>. A row selection is not required, and a selection 
    of one or more rows will not interfere with the use of the action. The New 
    action is available whether rows are selected or not.
  <LI><I>Single selection</I> <span style="white-space: pre;">(for example, as applies to an Edit action)</span>. This type of action requires a single row 
    to be selected. The Edit action will apply to the one object selected.
  <LI><I>Multiple selection</I> <span style="white-space: pre;">(for example, as applies to a Delete action)</span>. One or more rows must be selected for 
    this type of action. In the case of Delete, the one or multiple rows that 
    are selected will all be deleted when the Delete action is chosen.
</UL>
<p>This discussion focuses on actions associated with objects listed in a table. 
  However, in certain situations, these actions might also apply to nontabular 
  data where items are selected from a group. For example, a user may be able 
  to perform an action on an aggregate displayed in a graphical view of related 
  objects, as discussed in <A href="10-topology.html#10.6.3">10.6.3 Contextual 
  Menus</A>.</P>
<H3 ><a name="9.4.2"></a>9.4.2 General Guidelines for Table Actions</H3>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
  As noted in <a href="09-tables.html#9.1.2">9.1.2 Table Characteristics</a>, if the table typically does 
  not fit on one screen (with typical data, at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels with the standard font size), duplicate the table actions in the top and bottom action 
  bars. Here is an example:</p>
<p><img height="329" src="tables_graphics/table2.gif" width="820" alt="Example of a table with actions on the top and bottom"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
  If the application has one or two actions that users frequently need to use 
  to operate on the whole table, consider including an explicit action for handling 
  this situation (for example, a button labeled "Delete All Closed Alarms"). This can be especially useful for tables which typically have enough rows that they are usually shown paginated. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Require 
  confirmation from the user through means of a JavaScript (TM) alert message before 
  a destructive or long table action is performed. Confirmation 
  is especially important on actions in drop down menus, because users can inadvertently 
  select an unintended item while arrowing down. For information on alert 
  messages, see <a href="14-alerts.html">Chapter 14, Alerts and Messages</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  For table actions that require additional user input, include ellipsis points 
  after the action name (for example, "New..."). 
  For guidelines on when to use ellipsis points, see <a href="07-simple.html#7.1.6">7.1.6 
  Button Labels</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  For accessibility reasons, inform users when a table action opens a pop-up window 
  (see the following implementation guideline).</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" width="16" height="14" alt="Implementation Information" title="Implementation Information"> 
  For this purpose, you can place the appropriate text in a tool tip. For example, if an application 
  is started in a new main browser window that contains a device manager, the 
  text might read: "Start a device manager for this object (Opens a New Window)." 
  To implement the tool tip, place the appropriate text in the HTML "title" attribute of the table action. Similar text should be placed in the HTML "alt" attribute of the image for accessibility. That alt text is often identical to the tool tip, but may be made shorter and simpler.  For more information on accessibility guidelines, see <a href="D-accessibility.html">Appendix 
  D, Accessibility Requirements</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" width="14" height="14">&nbsp;Leave 
  objects selected after an action is performed unless doing so would make no 
  sense in your application. 
  <!--
<A few of the trade-offs are as follows:
ul>
  In favor of leaving checkboxes checked: 
  <ul>
    <li>The checked items should remain checked as feedback about which items 
      were acted on. 
    <li>This approach provides better support for multiple actions on the checked 
      items. 
    <li>This approach is consistent with the nonbrowser selection model. 
    <li>It is much easier for the user to clear all checkboxes (click one button) 
      than to reselect the desired checkboxes. 
  </ul>
  In favor of clearing them: 
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000">If all the selected objects have scrolled or paged 
      out of sight, the user might select a formerly unchecked item and execute 
      some other action on it, unaware that the new action will apply to some 
      other items as well. </font> 
    <li>An extra action is required to manually clear the selections<font color="#000000"> 
      if they are not needed for the next action.</font> 
  </ul>
</ul>-->
</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" width="14" height="14">&nbsp;If 
  the user takes an additional action irrelevant of the selections, such as creating 
  a new record, then clear the selections upon completion of that action. They 
  are not cleared until the action is completed, as the user might click New and 
  then cancel, and be disappointed to find the selections gone.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Make all table action buttons Secondary Buttons. See <a href="07-simple.html#7.1">7.1 Action Buttons</a> for more information on button styles.</p>

<H3 ><A name="9.4.3"></A>9.4.3 Design Options for Table Actions</H3>
<p>Several design options are available for table actions. The choice depends 
  on the number of actions and the types of actions (no selection, single selection, 
  and multiple selection) that the table needs to support. These guidelines are 
  intended to help you understand the complex set of usability trade-offs related 
  to designing table actions. Depending on the number and type of actions, five 
  options are currently available for designing table actions:</P>
<UL >
  <LI>Embedded table actions inside the table 
  <LI>All buttons in the action bar (between the table title bar and the column 
    headings bar) 
  <LI>A single drop-down menu in the action bar 
  <LI>A combination of buttons and a single drop-down menu in the action bar 
  <LI>A combination of buttons and/or a single drop-down menu in the action bar 
    with embedded table actions
</UL>
<p>Embedded table actions are ideal for single selection actions. Buttons (if few 
  actions) and a drop-down menu (if many actions) are useful for multiple selection 
  actions. Depending upon the application, you can use <i>certain</i> different combinations
  of these designs at the same time. However, if an application uses too many
  different designs, there is a danger of confusing the user. Whichever option
  or options you choose, always strive for internal consistency and a lack of
  clutter in the user interface design.</P>
  
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Use one or more of the design options described in this section for displaying 
  all the actions that apply to a table, whether the actions require a selection 
  or not. Do not create additional types of controls for actions that apply to 
  the table. <br>

  Positive:

  Negative:<br>

    <li>Actions embedded in menus are not visible to users at all times.
    <li>Requires three clicks to perform an action (one click to select the object,

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Use the primary object type in the table (for example, &quot;server&quot; 
  as in &quot;&#8212; Server Actions &#8212;&quot;) as part of the menu label. 
  If no primary object exists, then use a more generic fallback name (for example, 
  &quot;&#8212; Table Actions &#8212;&quot; or &quot;&#8212;  Actions &#8212;&quot;). Use a single em-dash and a nonbreaking 
  space before (&quot;&amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;&quot;) and after (&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8212;&quot;) 
  the menu label.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Use
  a series of em-dashes (&quot;&#8212;&quot; or &quot;&amp;#8212;&quot; as in &quot;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&quot;)
  to separate actions into distinct groups. The series of em-dashes act as a
  separator. They should generally be as long as the longest menu item label inside the
  menu.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;If

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" width="16" height="14" alt="Implementation Information" title="Implementation Information">&nbsp;The  implementation of the table guidelines uses the &lt;OPTGROUP&gt; tag to group items in structured menus. This implementation has several interaction benefits, including disabling group labels, but it also facilitates accessibility. The use of the &lt;OPTGROUP&gt; tag enables assistive technologies to read the structure of the menu as well as its content. </p>

  the drop-down menu such that after a menu item is selected, the menu snaps back

  page. This way, if the user clicks the Back button on the browser, the page 
  loads with the menu label selected in the menu. </p>
<ul >
  <li>An exception to this snap-back behavior: If a nonaction item, such as a 
    separator, is selected from an action menu, the item should remain selected 
    and the page should remain unchanged. This way, users are more likely to realize 
    that they have inadvertently selected an invalid item.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;To 
  reduce the number of user steps and to reduce clutter, do not use a Go (for 
  example, &quot;Submit&quot;) button next to action menus. Instead, make these menus exhibit 
  jump menu behavior, in which the action associated with the menu item is performed 
  when the user selects a menu item. The key combinations 
  Alt-Up Arrow and Alt-Down Arrow can still be used to move through the menu without 
  actuating any of the items inside, which is important for accessibility.</p>
<h4 ><a name="9.4.3.3"></a>9.4.3.3 Using Embedded Table Actions</h4>
<p>If your application requires only a small number of single selection actions, 
  then using embedded table actions is the simplest and most direct option. Embedded 
  table actions are different from navigation links in that they typically cause 
  an action, such as Edit or Load, to operate on an object. Conversely, navigation 
  links usually refresh the current page with new content or open a pop-up window.</p>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/embeddedactions.gif" width="750" height="275" border="0" alt="Example of a table with embedded actions"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Embedded table actions have these characteristics:</p>
<ul >
  <li>Their column heading must be labeled "Actions", and the column cannot be 
    sorted. 
  <li>If a column of radio buttons or checkboxes is used in the table, the Actions column should appear in the far right column of the table (see <a href="09-tables.html#embedded_right">the second picture in 9.4.3.4 Using a Combination of Methods for Table Actions</a>). 
  <li>If no
column of radio buttons or checkboxes is used in the table, the Actions column should be the far left 
    column of the table. The second column typically contains the object name. 
  <li>When there are multiple commands in a cell, separator bars should appear 
    between each command. Do not have a pipe character before or after the set of table actions, only between the commands in the set. 
  <li>The hyperlinked text for each command should not be underlined, except when 
    the mouse is over it. This is consistent with other 
    hyperlinking within the content area. 
</ul>
<p>Embedded table actions are particularly useful when the display is not visually 
  complex, and when an action is frequently used or differs by row.  </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Embed actions in the table when they are primarily used as single selection 
  actions, that is, when the action applies to one row at a time.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Use verbs when specifying embedded table actions.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Do not use embedded table actions if it is likely that their addition will cause 
  horizontal scrolling at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels with the standard 
  font size.<br>
  <br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Avoid disabling embedded table actions.  Any actions shown inline should be enabled and available, or not shown. <br>

<br>
In some cases, a single embedded table action can be changed (toggled) to the appropriate action based on the current state of the object listed on a given row. This is often appropriate when opposite actions apply to an object based on its state. For example, if embedded table actions include Start and Stop and the applicable action is based on the current state of the object, then if the object is currently stopped, the displayed embedded action would be Start, and vice versa. Do this where applicable instead of having two embedded table actions and disabling the one that does not apply given the object's current state. </p>
<p>Mix embedded table actions with <i>selection-independent</i> actions, if needed. 
  This combination can provide a useful mix of the different methods for offering 
  table actions to users. For example, Edit and Activate (or Deactivate, as appropriate 
  for the each row) actions could be provided as embedded table actions, while 
  the 'New' action could be provided as a button in the action bar. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Combining embedded table actions with selection-dependent actions should be 
  done cautiously. Users may not understand why some actions are embedded in the 
  table while others require selection of a checkbox, and then a button click 
  or drop-down menu selection. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Any given action should be presented consistently throughout the application. 
  For example, an Edit action should not appear as an embedded table action in 
  one table, and then as an "above-the-table" action in another table.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Do not generally embed more than two actions per row. A more firm maximum number 
depends on the visual density of the table data as a whole.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
  Group the embedded table actions so that the shared actions (actions that appear 
  in every row) come first, followed by actions that differ by row. This organization 
  gives the table a more ordered appearance.</p>

<ul >
  Positive:<br>

    <li>An action can be based on the state of the object in the row.<br>
  </ul>
  Negative:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>The design contributes to visual clutter and complexity. 
    <li>A dedicated actions column widens the table, which can cause content on the far right to extend beyond the user's view.

  <li>In a heavily used application with a class of very frequent single selection

<h3 ><a name="9.4.4"></a>9.4.4 Dynamic Enabling and Disabling of Table Actions</h3>
<p>Many desktop applications enable designers to disable actions
  that are unavailable at any given moment. For example, designers can:</p>
<ul >
  <li>Disable an action that requires an object to be selected until an 
    object is actually selected
  <li>Disable a single selection action if multiple objects have been selected
</ul>
<p>These simple examples represent cases in which actions can be dynamically enabled
  or disabled entirely on the client without accessing the server. In
  these cases, the user has simply selected objects listed in an action table
  (typically by clicking on a checkbox).</p>
<p>Of course, there are other situations in which a designer might want to display
  a disabled action that would require more complex, application-specific, logic.
  Typically, the state of the object would determine whether an action would
  be enabled or disabled. State-based actions, such as &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;, or &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Unload&quot;, are
  excellent examples of actions that could toggle between an enabled or disabled
  appearance. Such state-based actions would most likely require server access to verify 
  the state of the object.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Embedded table actions  
  should only include available actions for the current state (for 
  example, by specifying &quot;Load&quot; or &quot;Unload,&quot; but not both). 
  Embedded table actions should never be disabled.</p>

<p>  
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
For drop-down menus, when all menu items are temporarily disabled, disable the individual menu items 
instead of disabling the drop-down menu element itself.  This allows users to see what actions are 
possible, even if they are temporarily unavailable.

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;The
  iconic view-changing buttons for Multiple-Column Sort, Custom Filter, Clear Sort, and Table Preferences
  should not be dynamically enabled or disabled (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.6">9.5.6 View-Changing Buttons</a>).</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  an action is disabled, the following should happen:</p>
<ul >
  <li>The state should be changed to &quot;disabled&quot;, 
    and given a disabled appearance.
  <li>The item should not be clickable, and any tool tip should disappear.
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  an action is subsequently enabled, the following should happen:</p>
<ul >
  <li>The state should be changed to &quot;enabled&quot;,

For example, if the user has selected all the rows, and one of them is already in the state &quot;online&quot;, do not disable the action to set all to be online or give an error if the user attempts to do so. Instead, just set the others to be online. This makes for a less cumbersome user interface, since the user's objective will be accomplished anyway. This only applies to actions which set the state of items.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> There are cases where disabling a button may not give the best user interface, as the user may not be able to infer why the button is disabled, or what to do in order to enable it. For these cases, an alternative to disabling the button or table action menu item is to instead provide an error message when the user clicks it at an inappropriate time. For these, a  JavaScript alert (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.4">Chapter 14, Alerts and Messages</a>)
  is preferred over an inline alert because a JavaScript alert:</p>

<p> If a table allows a selected row to remain selected even when the user moves to a different page, that table is maintaining non-displayed selections. Tables supporting non-displayed selections are allowed when needed, but should be avoided if at all possible. Non-displayed selections can easily lead to user errors, such as deleting additional records unintentionally. Moreover, the user will often not know they have made this error, which makes the situation more serious. </p>
<p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Only provide tables supporting non-displayed selections when truly necessary for the application, as they can easily cause user errors when users act on rows on which they did not intend to act.</p>
<p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Never provide tables supporting non-displayed selections if only one selection at a time is allowed. If there can only be one selection at a time anyway, there is no reason to allow it to be out of sight when being acted upon. <br>
  <br>
<img src="tables_graphics/hidden_selections.gif" width="788" height="257"></p>
<p>For tables supporting non-displayed selections:</p>
<blockquote >
  <p>  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;The table should display &quot;Selections Not Displayed: N&quot; on right side of table titlebar and centered in the table footer, where N is a numeric value dynamically updated on each page load. If the table already has content to display in the footer, that content should be left-aligned and &quot;Selections Not Displayed: N&quot; should be right-aligned in the footer. This should be shown even when there are 0 non-displayed selections currently, as an indicator to the user that they can select items on this page and then proceed to other pages to make additional selections, before taking actions.</p>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;If a table action is taken that affects non-displayed selections, the confirmation message should specify how many non-displayed selections  will be affected, to alert the user. The following format should be used for the messages. For example, if the action is archiving, the message should be: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Selections Not Displayed: 2 <br>
      Total Selections: 10</p>
    <p>Archive all selections?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If a warning was already appropriate for that table action, the confirmation message should specify how many non-displayed selections  will be affected, and then the warning regarding that action. The following format should be used for the messages. For example, if the action was deletion, the message should be: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Selections Not Displayed: 2<br>
      Total Selections: 10

<h2 ><a name="9.5"></a>9.5 Changing Table Views</h2>
<p>There are two basic ways to change the visible content of a table to 
  make it easier for users to find and view information included in the 
  table. Filtering displays a subset of material found in the table. 
  Sorting enables users to arrange data in ways that make the most sense 
  for them. Sorting can be done directly by manipulating column heads, or 
can be done by calling up a multi-column sort panel.</p>
<h3 ><a name="9.5.1"></a>9.5.1 Table Filtering</h3>
<p>Table filtering allows users to reduce the display of data to items that meet 
  a specific set of criteria. Table filtering is optional but might be useful 
  when users need to focus on a specific subset of the data being displayed at 
  any given time. Two types of table filtering are available:&nbsp;basic and custom. 
  Basic table filtering uses elements that are displayed in a table's action bar 
  and is restricted to a predetermined set of options. In contrast, custom table 
  filtering uses elements that are displayed in an inserted panel below the table's  action bar and may include 
  many options to include or exclude data.</p>
<p>Unlike search, filter is a tool used to draw out a subset from an existing 
  group of objects based on inclusive criteria, and does not substantially change 
  the format of the original object presentation. Filtering shows the results in the original table, while search shows it in a new search results display. See <a href="12-search.html">Chapter 
  12 Search</a> to see how search is different.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Preserve the filter unless the user explicitly changes it.</p>
<p>In particular, remember to preserve the filter when:</p>
<ul >
  <li>Data fields are refreshed. 
  <li>The user leaves the page and then returns to it.

<h4 ><a name="9.5.1.1"></a>9.5.1.1 Basic Table Filtering</h4>
<p>Basic table filtering involves filtering data from a predetermined list of 
  items. &nbsp;For example, you might want to permit users to filter a heterogeneous 
  list of managed objects by type. In this case, the drop-down menu could list 
  all of the possible object types. Users would be able to choose one object type 
  for inclusion.</p>
<p>Basic filtering should be used when the collection of objects to be filtered
  can be displayed inside a table. Typically, this case occurs when the
  table already contains all the objects under consideration but is too large
  to comfortably view a specific subset of the objects. However, if the collection of objects
  is so diverse that it does not make sense to display them in a table, then
  a search action should be used to collect them together into a results page. &nbsp;See <a href="12-search.html#12.1">12.1
  Quick Search</a> for more details.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;To
  allow user control over table filtering, insert the text label &quot;Filter&quot; and
  a drop-down menu with the available options in the action bar. The UI 
  elements for basic filtering should appear to the right of table actions but
  to the left of iconic buttons and the vertical pagination toggle. Place separator bars between the 
  basic filter controls and the other UI elements.
  See <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.6">9.5.6 View-Changing Buttons</a> for more details.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;The all-inclusive value for the Filter dropdown is &quot;All Items&quot;. This can be made more specific, such as &quot;All Servers&quot;, or &quot;All Updates&quot;, but should not say simply &quot;All&quot; as &quot;Filter: All&quot; is confusing with all the filters being applied. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> Usually provide a basic filter  which displays only selected items for tables which support non-displayed selections (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a> for more information). This will allow the user to see all selected items, even when they had previous been spread across multiple pages. </p>
<p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
  When first displaying the table, do not use any filter at all. The filter drop-down 
  menu should show &quot;All Items&quot; as the default value. The 
  exception for this is when the user comes to the table with an implicit filter, 
  such as clicking on a particular alarm severity in the masthead. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When 
  a user initiates a filter, show only the items that match the filter criteria. 
  In other words, the basic table filter is &quot;inclusive.&quot; For example,  
  &quot;Critical&quot;, &quot;Alarmed&quot;, or &quot;Submitted Today.&quot;</p>
<p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> If you cannot simply and clearly expressexpress which values are displayed by specifying what is <em>included</em>, instead use 
  the word &quot;Not&quot; before the  criterion of what is <em>excluded</em> (for example, 
  &quot;Not Minor&quot;).</p>
<p> Basic Table Filtering is conceptually similar to <a href="12-search.html#12.1.1.1">12.1.1.1 
  Global Quick Search: Predefined Queries</a> and <a href="12-search.html">12.1.2.1 
  Local Quick Search: Predefined Queries</a> in that they offer predefined criteria. 
  However Local Quick Search is usable across any Local scope (not limited to 
  a single table on a single page) and both of the searches present their results 
  on a dedicated results page, while filters just limit what is seen on an otherwise 
  unchanged page.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a table using basic filtering, where all items are currently 
  displayed:</p>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/table-basicfilter-title.gif" width="786" height="229" alt="Example of a table with a basic filter"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  the user initiates a filter, use all the table data to determine the filter, even
  when the table is paginated.</p>
<p>A paginated table uses vertical pagination buttons and elements to move table
  rows in and out of view. In a paginated table, filtering might change which
  data rows are displayed in the table.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;If 
  a filter operation results in previously selected items no longer
  being visible, unless the table allows Selections Not Displayed (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a> for more information) two things must happen:</p>
<ul >
  <li>The previously selected items are deselected.</li>
  <li>They are not included in any subsequent user actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;After 
  the user performs a filter operation, </p>
<ul >
  <li>The filter drop-down menu should display the currently selected filter.

  <li>The 
  phrase <b>&quot;: [filter name] Filter Applied</b>&quot; should be appended

<h4 ><a name="9.5.1.2"></a>9.5.1.2 Custom Table Filtering</h4>
<p> Custom table filtering allows users to filter table data by more than one
  criterion at a time. For example, users might want to filter a table of alarms
  by both alarm severity (critical alarms only) and object type (storage arrays
  only).</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
To allow users to do custom filtering, include an option in the Filter drop-down menu called &quot;Custom Filter...&quot;. Choosing this option causes a panel to be inserted below the action bar which contains user interface elements for specifying custom filter criteria. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Use the following guidelines for the filter drop-down menu:</p>
<ul >
  <li>If the menu contains both basic filtering options and the &quot;Custom Filter...&quot;&nbsp;option, then separate the two by a row of em-dashes (&quot;&#8212;&quot; or &quot;&amp;#8212;&quot; as in &quot;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&quot;). The sequence would be &quot;All Items&quot;, basic filtering options, the separator, and finally, &quot;Custom Filter...&quot;.
  <li>Once the &quot;Custom Filter...&quot; option has been selected, insert the Custom Filter panel within the table and display &quot;Custom  Filter...&quot; in the Filter drop-down menu. Note that &quot;Custom Filter...&quot; is only shown as the selected option in the drop-down menu when the Custom Filter panel is displayed. At all other times, the drop-down menu will display the current filter that is in effect. 
  <li>If the menu only contains the &quot;Custom Filter...&quot; option, then the sequence would be &quot;All Items&quot; followed immediately by &quot;Custom Filter...&quot;. Do not display a row of em-dashes.  
  <li>Once a custom filter is applied, insert and display &quot;Custom Filter Applied&quot; in the drop-down menu.
  <li>Remove &quot;Custom Filter Applied&quot; from the list of drop-down menu options whenever the user has selected something else in the menu. For example, if the user had applied a custom filter and &quot;Custom Filter Applied&quot; is displayed in the drop-down menu, remove this option from the drop-down menu once the user chooses &quot;All Items&quot;, or a basic filter. (For technical reasons, it remains in the drop-down menu if the user
selects "Custom Filter..." again.)<br>
  <br>
  The &quot;Custom Filter Applied&quot; option is intended to be used only for display purposes. &quot;Custom Filter Applied&quot; is only available for selection if it was already being displayed when the user opens the list. Selecting it in this case would simply close the list and nothing else would happen. That is standard behavior for re-selecting the currently selected option in a drop-down menu. 
</ul>
<p>The Custom Filter panel may contain a variety of different simple 
  UI elements for specifying filtering criteria. These elements may include drop-down 
  menus, checkbox sets, radio button sets, and so forth. &nbsp;The choice of UI 
  element should depend on the datatype being filtered.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Label the Custom Filter panel &quot;Custom Filter.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Provide buttons labeled &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; at the bottom  of the  panel. Make the OK button a primary button, and the Cancel button  a secondary button. <br>
  <br>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Arrange the criteria options in the  Custom Filter panel from top to bottom. However, if there are numerous fields, and horizontal space allows, use columns of criteria options to maximize use of the horizontal space available while minimizing the amount of vertical space needed for the criteria options.<br>

<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Inclusive 
  filters are the default for the Custom Filter panel; however, both 
  inclusive and exclusive filters may be used. If an exclusive filter is used, 
  it must be explicitly labeled as such. For example, the menu label might be 
either &quot;Exclude...&quot; or the specific item might say &quot;Not X.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When the  Custom Filter panel is displayed, use the data from the last <em>applied</em> custom filter to determine the defaults for the filter criteria.

<h3 ><a name="9.5.2"></a>9.5.2 Table Sorting</h3>
<p>Table sorting allows users to arrange data according to their information
  needs. Table sorting is also useful when all data cannot be viewed at once.</p>
<p>
There are two methods available for sorting tables: One method is to sort the table directly, using the elements in the table's column headers.  The other method is to use the Multiple-Column Sort panel. These methods of sorting are described in detail in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.1">9.5.2.1 Direct Table Sorting</a> and <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.2">9.5.2.2 Multiple-Column Sort Panel </a>.</p>
<p>  A table can be designed to allow users to sort on a sub-set of the table's columns, or on all of them. The more columns that are made sortable, the more flexibility the user has in organizing the table's data as desired. However, there may be times when it does not make sense to enable sorting for the table, in general, or for certain columns. For example, a table that will only ever contain a handful of rows that are displayed in the most logical sort order would not need sorting enabled. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Enable table sorting for:</p>
<ul >
  <li>Most large tables when all data cannot be viewed at once
  <li>Any table where it is important for users to arrange data in different ways
</ul>
<p>Any time more than one column is sortable, the user can choose to sort by one column at a time or may choose to combine more than one column in a <em>multiple-column sort</em>. </p>
<p>Multiple-column table sorting involves ordering data by multiple table columns at once.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Allow users to sort by multiple columns when they might want to view data sorted by two or more columns at once.</p>
<p>For example, users might want to use multiple-column sorting for related columns such as Last Name and First Name. Alternatively, multiple-column sorting can add some logical order to table rows when a single sort results in a large number of rows with the same redundant value.</p>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When users change the primary sort order from one column to another, use the original sort as an implicit secondary sort. This sort order, called a <I>stable sort,</I> requires that only one previous sort order be maintained. Do not indicate this implicit secondary sort with any explicit labeling, however. </p>
<p>For example, assume the original sort was on First Name in ascending order. Then, the user sorts on Last Name in ascending order. As a result, all the "Smiths" are grouped together and arranged in ascending order by first name.</P>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the user initiates or reverses a sort, use all the data to determine the sort, even when the table is paginated.</p>
<p>A paginated table uses vertical pagination buttons and elements (<A href="09-tables.html#9.5.4">9.5.4 Vertical Pagination in Tables</A>) to move table rows in and out of view. In a paginated table, sorting might change which data rows are displayed in the table.</P>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Except for tables which allow non-displayed selections (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a> for more information):</p>
<ul >
  <li>The
        state of selected items that are no longer visible as the result of a sort
      must change to an unselected state. </li>
  <li>For this reason, if the table is currently paginated, disable the selection column sort reversal icon when the selection column is sorted, as otherwise the selections the user has requested sorting by would be lost by reversing the sort. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;The
  user may choose to sort the table by the currently selected items. In the following example, 
  the user previously clicked the sort icon in the checkbox column:</p>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/sorted_by_selection.gif" width="838" height="534" alt="Example of a table sorted by the selection column"></p>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> The table's sort order should be remembered while the user is on that page, even while moving through "pages" of the table data and refreshing the page.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;In most cases, the table's sort order  should  be remembered if the user drills down to a page from it and comes back up.&nbsp;</p>
<H4 ><A name="9.5.2.1"></A>9.5.2.1 Direct Table Sorting</H4>
<p>Direct table sorting involves specifying the sort one column at a time, by directly clicking column headers and sort arrows in the table. Review the following sequence of images to see the results of typical
sort actions (tool tips describe the sort actions).</P>
<p>User has clicked the Last Name column header to sort by that column (and remained hovering on it, showing the tool tip which has not changed): </P>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/directsort1.gif" width="821" height="532"></P>
<p>User now hovers over icon to add First Name to the sort:</P>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/directsort3.gif" width="824" height="530"></P>

Set the maximum width  of this text to 375 pixels.<br>
  <br>
Here is an example of a table with an inserted Multiple-Column Sort panel:</p>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/multi-sort-panel2.gif" width="823" height="486" alt="Image showing inserted multiple column sort panel"></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Design  the Multiple-Column Sort panel so that it displays two side-by-side drop-down 
        menus for each sort criterion, allowing users to specify both the column and 
        the sort order.</p>
<p>Each left-hand drop-down menu 
  allows users to choose which table column to sort. Each right-hand drop-down menu 
  allows users to choose the sort order (ascending or descending) for that table 
  column.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Include up to three pairs of drop-down menus in the Multiple-Column Sort panel. Label the pairs of drop-down menus &quot;Primary Sort Column:&quot;, &quot;Secondary Sort Column:&quot;, and &quot;Tertiary Sort Column:&quot;. Note that if there are only two sortable columns in the table, only two pairs of drop-down menus would be displayed.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When 
  the Multiple-Column Sort panel is first displayed, use the current sort order
  to determine the defaults in the drop-down menus, as applicable. Otherwise, 
  use &quot;(none)&quot; in the left-hand drop-down menu and &quot;Ascending&quot; 
  in the right-hand drop-down menu. If no columns are currently sorted, all  pairs of drop-down menus would display &quot;(none)&quot; in the left-hand drop-down menu and &quot;Ascending&quot; in the right-hand drop-down menu by default.</p>

<p>In the rare case where the current sort contains greater than three columns,  only the first three columns of the sort  will be indicated in the drop-down menus in the Multiple-Column Sort panel.  If the user then applies a sort using the  panel, the sort will simply drop to using a maximum of three columns, as specified in the drop-down menus.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;If the current sort uses only one column, indicate just that single  column  in the drop-down menus of the Multiple-Column Sort panel, even if a stable sort is in place (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2">9.5.2  Table Sorting</a> for more information about stable sorts). </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;Except for tables which allow non-displayed selections (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a> for more information), if the table is currently paginated, disable the value Descending when the selection column is selected as the sort column, as otherwise the selections the user has requested sorting by would be lost by sorting descending. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When the user clicks on the OK button in the Multiple-Column Sort panel, the following events take place:  </p>
<ul >
  <li>The specified sort is checked using client-side validation to make sure the same column has not been selected in more than one left-hand drop-down menu and that the user has specified columns in order. For example, it is not valid to specify a tertiary sort column without having first specified a primary and secondary sort column. <br>
    If there is a problem, a javascript alert will be presented and the user must fix the problem before applying the sort. </li>
  <li>The specified sort is applied, and the Multiple-Column Sort panel is removed from display.</li>
  <li>The  Multiple-Column Sort iconic button is returned to its default appearance. </li>
  <li>The applied sort is represented visually in the table as if the sort had been applied directly using UI elements in the column header.</li>
</ul>
<p> For more information about direct sorting using UI elements in the column header, see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.1">9.5.2.1 Direct Table Sorting</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a sort was applied directly, or by using the Multiple-Column Sort panel, the user will be free to make changes to the sort by either method. Note, however that the Multiple-Column Sort panel is limited to sorting only up to three columns at once. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If the user invokes the Multiple-Column Sort panel, specifies a sort, and then presses the Cancel button, the following events take place:

  <li>The Multiple-Column Sort iconic button is returned to its default appearance.</li>
  <li> The table is returned to its current sort, as if the Multiple-Column Sort iconic button had never been clicked.</li>
</ul>
 <p>The next time the panel is displayed, base the defaults in the drop-down menus on the current sort. The sort that had been specified in the panel but never applied is lost.<br>
    <br>
  This same behavior is also true if the user simply switches to a different panel such as Table Preferences or Custom Filter without applying the sort. Multiple-column sorts that had been specified but never applied are lost.

<h4 ><a name="9.5.2.3" id="9.5.2.3"></a>9.5.2.3 Natural Sort Order and Clearing Sorts</h4>
<p>Some tables have a natural sort order. This is an order of the rows which cannot be achieved by sorting any of the visible columns. It might be the order the items were entered, for example. This order is typically the order in which the table is originally displayed to the user. Whenever providing either single or multiple-cclumn sorting for a table which has an implicit sort order, consider providing a Clear Sort iconic button <img src="tables_graphics/sort_clear.gif" alt="Clear Sort Button" width="23" height="20"> so the user can return to this order. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> For tables which have a natural sort order, and do not have a Multiple-Column Sort panel (generally due to having only one sortable column), always provide a Clear All Sorts button. This will be the only way the user can return to the natural sort order.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> For tables with a Multiple-Column Sort panel, an alternative way for users to clear all sorts exists -- the user can use the Multiple-Column Sort panel and clear all sorts by choosing &quot;(none)&quot; in all 3 sort column drop-down menus. However, clearing sorts in the Multiple-Column Sort panel is not very intuitive, so a Clear Sort button should still be provided if it is an important function. </p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.2">9.5.2.2 Multiple-Column Sort Panel </a> and <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.6">9.5.6 View-Changing Buttons</a>. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If provided, the Clear All Sorts button goes just to the right of the Multiple-Column Sort iconic button <img src="tables_graphics/sort_panel.gif" width="23" height="20" alt="Multiple-Column Sort Button"> if one is present. If there is no Multiple-Column Sort iconic button, place the Clear All Sorts button to the right of any table action elements and the filter drop-down menu, if displayed. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the the Clear All Sorts button is pressed, all sorting on the table is removed, and the table reverts to its natural sort order. </p>
<h3 ><a name="9.5.3"></a>9.5.3 Table Preferences</h3>
<p>Table preferences allow users to change additional parameters affecting how 
  table data are displayed. These parameters may include, but are not restricted 
  to, the following:</p>
<ul >
  <li>The number of rows to display on a single page when using vertical pagination 
    (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.4">9.5.4 Vertical Pagination in Tables</a>) (This is the most common 
    entry.)
  <li>Which data columns to show
  <li>The order of displayed columns
  <li>The default sort order for the table or for specific columns
</ul>
<p>In most cases, changes to table preferences are maintained for the
  length of a user session.  However, applications may also make such
changes persistent across sessions.<br>
<br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">To allow users to specify table preferences, display a Table Preferences iconic button, <img src="tables_graphics/preferences_panel.gif" width="23" height="20" alt="Table Preferences Button">, in the table's action bar, to the right of any table action elements, the filter drop-down menu, if displayed, and any sorting iconic buttons that may be displayed. When this button is clicked:</p>
<ul >
  <li>A Table Preferences panel is inserted below the table's top action bar. This panel displays user interface elements for customizing the table. One typical use for this panel is to allow users to specify the number of rows to display per page. </li>
  <li>The Table Preferences iconic button changes to <img src="tables_graphics/preferences_panel_flip.gif" width="23" height="20" alt="Table Preferences Button with background color matching the Table Preferences panel"> while  the Table Preferences panel is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on this button (including the appropriate tool tip), see

</ul>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If the user invokes the Table Preferences  panel, specifies some preferences, and then presses the Cancel button, the following events take place:

  <li> The specified table preferences are discarded, as if the Table Preferences iconic button had never been clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time the panel is displayed, base the defaults for the  user interface elements in the Table Preferences panel on the last applied preferences. The preferences that had been specified in the panel but never applied are lost.<br>
  <br>
This same behavior is also true if the user simply switches to a different panel such as  Custom Filter or Multiple-Column Sort without applying the preferences. Preferences that had been specified but never applied are lost.

<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When
  all table rows cannot be viewed at once, provide vertical pagination in one
  of two ways:</P>
<UL >
  <LI>Using the browser's vertical scrollbar, which scrolls the entire length
    of the browser window.
  <LI>Using vertical pagination, which moves table rows in and out of view. A
    table that uses this feature is called a <I>paginated table</I>. Each set
    of rows that moves into view is called a <I>page</I> of the table.
</UL>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> In
  most cases, use the browser's scrollbar to scroll vertically. However, use
  vertical pagination under these conditions:</P>
<UL >
  <LI>Loading an entire table presents performance issues and results in an unacceptable
    load time.
  <LI>The table is so large that actions might be very far apart from the data
    that users are viewing (for example, the user has scrolled to the middle of a very
    large and unpaginated table, and cannot see either the actions
    on the top or the bottom).
  <LI>It is critical for the row of table column headings to always be in view.
  <LI>The use of filtering still results in a table that is difficult
    for users to view or perform actions on.
</UL>
<p>Data from various surveys recently conducted with system administrators indicate 
  that the most common screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels. Given this screen 
  resolution, it would take a table with about 25 data 
  rows before considerable scrolling would be required to view the entire table. 
  This includes both the action bar on the top and the action bar with detailed 
  pagination controls at the bottom. See <A href="09-tables.html#9.5.4.1">9.5.4.1 Vertical Pagination 
  User Interface Elements</A> for more information.</P>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
  Provide pagination for a table with 25 or more rows, by default. However, it 
  is often helpful to allow the user to override this page size with a setting 
  in the Table Preferences window as shown above. </P>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> 
  Adjust the number 25 for your application if a number close to it would put 
  the data into more appropriate pages. For example, if showing data about months, 
  showing 24 rows per page would allow exactly two years of data per page, which 
  would be more helpful for the user than having the first month of the next year 
  added at the bottom and having that number get one farther off on each subsequent 
  page. </P>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Do 
  not offer vertical pagination when the data will never require more than about 
  25 rows (set the page size to be large so it is not invoked by the component) rather 
  than having a few rows sometimes get pushed to another page.</P>
<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">  If pagination is provided, no matter how few rows would be on the last page, limit the number of rows on

<p><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If
  the user initiates a sort in a paginated table, use all the data to determine

  always the rightmost items in the action bars.</P>
<p>The iconic toggle button is placed both at the top and the bottom of the table

<p>The UI elements necessary to support vertical pagination are as
  follows:
<UL >
  <LI>An iconic toggle button to allow users to switch between viewing all
    data on a single page that the user can scroll through and using vertical 
	pagination to see the data in multiple pages that the user can view one page at a time.
  <LI>A set of elements that allow users to change the set of rows that are being
    displayed at any given moment. These elements are sometimes referred to as <I>page-changing</I> elements.
</UL>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;If
  at all possible, structure tables so that horizontal
  scrolling is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Consider the target platform and a screen size of 1024x768 when designing the table layout.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline">&nbsp;In 
  many cases, horizontal scrolling can be avoided by allowing wrapping in long 
  text columns like description or comment fields, and that is usually preferable 
  to horizontal scrolling which can scroll key identifying information out of 
  view. </p>
<p>This wrapping is allowed automatically by the browser 
  and table component, so will occur unless it is specifically turned off by the application 
  program. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">&nbsp;When
  horizontal scrolling is necessary, use the browser's
  horizontal scrollbar to allow users to view columns that extend beyond the
  visible area of the screen.</p>
<p>The option of using horizontal pagination buttons (similar to vertical pagination
  buttons) has been researched. However, technical and usability issues need
  to be resolved before this option can be implemented.</p>
<p>Another option to explore in the future: allowing users to control which columns
  are displayed in a table, and in what order they appear. These table preferences
  could then be stored for future use. See <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.3">9.5.3 Table Preferences</a> and <a href="03-windows-pages_Popup_Windows.html">3.2 Pop-Up Windows</a> guidelines for more detail.</p>

<p>To reduce the confusion between actions that affect data in the table

  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If sorting is provided for the table, the sorting should be done for the items within each group. The order of the groups themselves does not change. </p>

  <p>Optionally, column footers applying only to the group may be shown, either instead of or in addition to column footers for the entire table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Group and item selection behavior: </p>
<ul >
  <li>The user can check the checkbox left of the turner to select all the items in  a group, whether it is currently opened or closed. </li>
  <li>If the user selects the group checkbox, then deselects a single checkbox within the group, the group changes to deselected. </li>
  <li>If the user unchecks the group checkbox to deselect all checkboxes, then selects a single checkbox, the group checkbox remains deselected unless and until all items in the group have been selected. </li>
  <li>Once all items in a group have been selected by the user, the group checkbox is automatically selected to reflect this. </li>
</ul>
<p> Indicating selections in collapsed groups: If the user closes a group with one or more items inside it selected, but not all items are selected, the user would have no reminder that these selections exist (the group checkbox would be unchecked and the group would be closed). Therefore, if a partial subset of the group is selected and the group is closed, the small warning icon  <img src="tables_graphics/group_selections_warning.gif" alt="Warning icon for group contains hidden selections" width="11" height="11"> should be displayed next to the turner icon, as shown in the second group in the example below. </p>

<p>Currently, grouped tables only allow one level of hierarchy. Multiple level hierarchies are being explored, however. </p>
<p>Grouped tables cannot currently be paginated. However, in the future, the two features may coexist. If and when grouped tables are paginated, the pagination breaks will only occur between groups, not in the middle of a group. The number of groups to show per page will have to be set reasonably to the number of items per group (perhaps dynamically for each table).</p>

<h2><a name="9.6" id="9.6"></a>9.6 AJAX Table (Next Generation Table)</h2>
<p><span class="level1">This is the design for a next-generation web-application table, using new capabilities provided by AJAX and other technologies. This section covers the things which are different about that table. All details not covered here follow the guidelines above for standard tables. For example, column alignment of different data types can be found above, and is not repeated here.</span></p>
<h3><a name="9.6.1"></a>9.6.1 AJAX Table Overview</span></h3>
<p class="level1">AJAX provides many new capabilities for tables which extend what can be done in simple HTML. The new AJAX table allows the rows to scroll independently of the rest of the page (including the header information which then can remain visible) and of the column headers (allowing users to see what &quot;7&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, etc. are referring to once they have scrolled down). This design also uses drawers and other progressive disclosure techniques more than the standard table, to allow users to focus their attention on the data and the actions they will perform on that data, not on the myriad of controls for optionally changing how the data is shown. Last, additional new capabilities are provided beyond the standard table, including resizing, reordering and removing columns, exporting data, etc. </p>
<h3><a name="9.6.2" id="9.6.2"></a>9.6.2 General Anatomy</h3>
<p><img src="tables_graphics/table_callouts.png"></p>
<h3><a name="9.6.3" id="9.6.3"></a>9.6.3 Basic Interactions</h3>
<h4><A name="9.6.3.1" id="9.6.3.1"></A>9.6.3.1 Object Selection</h4>
<p> As in the standard table, the primary selection mechanism is a checkbox for each Table Row, located in a Selection Column, which can be operated by mouse or by keyboard when on the checkbox field. However, users will now also have the ability to select ranges of rows by clicking the selection checkbox on one row and then shift-clicking the selection checkbox on another, thereby selecting all rows including and between the two rows. This can be done whether or not the first row selected remains in view. By keyboard, this will be done by the user selecting a checkbox, arrowing to another row, and then holding down shift while selecting another checkbox.</p>
<p>Note that the selection actions above will only be possible on the selection checkbox due to possible conflicts with links 
or editable fields in other columns. As the user has to use the selection checkbox anyway for all actions other than inline actions, there is also no need to support control-click. For now, we will not try to support control-shift-click, which is a way to select multiple ranges at once. This is primarily for simplicity.</p>
<p>As in the standard table, a radio-button version will be supported. Since row-actions will handle most of the need for doing actions on individual rows, this will primarily be for allowing users to select one row of the table as a choice, such as in a wizard.</p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> As in standard tables, these tables will include a control for selecting/deselecting all items in a list, but will be done with a pop-up menu instead of iconic buttons. Located within the column heading for the Selection Column, clicking the control will elicit a pop-up menu as shown above.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span>  Choosing 'Select All' from this control should select every item in the table, not just the items that are currently visible or currently cached on the client. Of course, if some items have been excluded due to a filter, those items are not selected. </p>
<p> How to treat non-displayed selected items: It will be possible for our users to make selections that then scroll well off-screen. Should they enact an action on the currently-selected items, they may well include items that they'd forgotten about in the action and suffer unintended consequences. </p>
<p>To counter this, the new tables will do three things:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 1. Keep a running Selection Summary in the  Header Bar above the rows. This will give a running tally of the total number of items selected, as shown in the picture below.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span>  The Selection Summary should update in real-time, with no full-page (or even full-table) refresh necessary. See <a href="09-tables.html#9.6.4">9.6.4 Lazy Data Download and Progress Indication</a>.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 2. Display a confirmation message before carrying out any action on a set of items that includes non-displayed items. Refer to <span><a href="09-tables.html#9.4.5">9.4.5 Maintaining Non-Displayed Selections</a></span> for the specifics of this message.</p>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 3. Allow tables to be sortable by the Selection Column (see illustration above). This will permit users to quickly toggle to a sort-order that shows all their selected items together. <br>

<h4><A name="9.6.3.3" id="9.6.3.3"></A>9.6.3.3. Performing an Action on an Item</h4>
<p> Once an item, or a number of items, have been selected, users can enact actions on the selected items using the standard methods discussed in <a href="09-tables.html#9.4">9.4 Table Actions.</a> However, Embedded Table Actions (see <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.3.3">9.4.3.3 Using Embedded Table Actions)</a> will be replaced with a pop-up menu as shown below. </p>
<p> <img

<p>These pop-up menu actions can be done on any row if provided, and operate on the row of the icon regardless of the table's selection state. The control for opening them will become a down-arrow icon as shown above.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> These actions are like the Embedded Table Actions discussed in <a href="09-tables.html#9.4.3.3">9.4.3.3 Using Embedded Table Actions</a>. However, the column used by the pop-up menu will always be on the left (right of  the selection column if there is one), unlike in standard tables where the embedded actions move to the right if there is a selection column. Additionally, if multiple actions are available for a row, rather than listing each side by side, there will just be just the one icon.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Clicking the icon will open a pop-up menu of the available actions for that row. Choosing an action will perform the action and then close the pop-up menu. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Clicking outside the pop-up menu will close it without taking an action.
  </li>
</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The inline actions will be operable by keyboard: If the user tabs to the icon and then presses Return or Space, the menu should open. The user can then arrow to the desired item and press Return or Space to choose it. If the user presses Escape, the menu should close without taking an action.</p>
<span><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span><span> Even if there is only one action, this same popup menu should be used. This avoids the issue of an action name looking just like data in the table.

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When the user tabs through the page, they should tab right into the table, first through the controls and then into the rows themselves. The user should then be able to move by keyboard within the table, arrowing up and down to move among rows and using left and right arrows or tab/back-tab to move among cells (see exception in <a href="09-tables.html#9.6.3.7">9.6.3.7. Inline Editing</a>).</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When at the top or bottom edge of the displayed rows, but other rows exist, the arrow key should scroll the table one row to show each next row and land on it.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"></span> If possible, Home should move to the first cell in the row, End should move to the last cell, and Page Up and Page Down should scroll the table by one page.</p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The cursor should change when it's over the boundary-line to the <img src="tables_graphics/Resize_Cursor.png" width="27" height="19"> cursor, to indicate that the border can be moved.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"></span> When a user has changed the column widths, that change should be retained for the next time someone logs in under that username and views that table. </p>
<h4><br>
<A name="9.6.3.6" id="9.6.3.6"></A>9.6.3.6. Sorting of Columns</h4>
<p> Table contents can be sorted by column, with the ability to set both a primary and secondary sort-order. Sorting is achieved by clicking on a column header.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> if <i>no</i> sort-order is currently specified, then clicking on a column head should display a pop-up menu with the following options: </p>
<p><span><img 
 src="tables_graphics/sort_column-1.png" alt=""><br>
  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> <span>Selecting either of those two options will establish the clicked column as the <i>primary</i> sort column for that table. Clicking again on the primary-sort column header would reveal the addition of one item to the resulting pop-up menu: <br>
  <br>
  <img 
 src="tables_graphics/sort_column-2.png" alt=""><br>
  <br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> <span>Selecting 'Clear All Sorts' will restore the table to its default (initial load-state) sort-order. </span></p>
<p><span><span><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> <span></span>Additionally, one can select a <i>secondary</i> sort-order for the table. If a primary sort-order has already been specified, then clicking on <em>any other column's</em> header would yield the following pop-up menu: <br>
  <br>
  <img 
 src="tables_graphics/sort_column-3.png" alt=""><br>
  <br>
      </span>
</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Selecting an option from 'Sort This Column Only' would <i>reset</i> the primary sort-order, from whatever column currently dictates primary sort to the column clicked upon. Selecting an option from 'Add This Column to the Sort' would specify that column (with the ordering selected, Ascending or Descending) as the next sort-order for the table. 'Clear All Sorts' <span>will restore the table to its default (initial load-state) sort-order. </span></p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The separator lines, 'Sort This Column Only', and 'Add This Column to the Sort' should not be selectable.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> As shown in the Selection section above, the selection column adds 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' commands at the top of this pop-up, above a separator line. </p>

<A name="9.6.3.7" id="9.6.3.7"></A>9.6.3.7. Inline Editing</h4>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> If a row has editible cells, they should be indicated with an outline box around each editable cell, when the user is on that row. No indications are done on rows other than the current row. If the user then clicks within one of the indicated cells, or arrows/tabs to it, the cell becomes editable, and defaults to being in overstrike mode so the user can immediately begin typing a new value. The user can also click a second time within the cell to instead set an insertion cursor, rather than being in overstike mode.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Once editing a cell, the left and right arrow keys move by character within the editable cell rather than to the adjacent cells. However, up and down arrows will move to adjacent rows, and tabbing will move to the next cell within the row. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When exiting fields, data validation should be possible (to be done by the application, not the table component, but available to the application to do).<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="9.6.4" id="9.6.4"></a>9.6.4 Lazy Data Download and Progress Indication </h3>
<p>The application should load into the table only the currently shown rows and a limited number of rows below. As the user scrolls, the system continues to load the rows to display and a limited number of rows above and below (note: a recommended formula is presented below, but we will definitely have to tweak this formula to achieve this), allowing quickly moving to the areas in proximity. However, pagination controls are still provided for accessibility (screen readers otherwise cannot scroll to other data), and can be used as fast "next set" and &quot;previous set&quot;
buttons for all users. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"></span> Previously-viewed rows should not be cached - unless they fall within this "range of readiness" - so as not to hinder browser rendering performance. (However, edited rows may need to be cached to retain the edits made, and this may have to be adjusted for implementation issues.)</p>
<p> <img title="Implementation Information" height=14 alt="Implementation Information"  src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" width=16 > Implementation suggestion for row caching: might try caching of the object name column value (or perhaps sorted column value) for display during scrolling. When user stops scrolling, load values for all columns for displayed rows.</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The table's scrollbar should have a thumb (the draggable portion of the scrollbar) that is proportionally-sized to indicate: (a) the relative position of the currently-displayed items within the overall set; and (b) the relative 'size' of the overall set. Obviously, this will be an inexact science -- it's probably fine if the calculations are performed upon the <i>numbers</i> of items alone, and not the actual screen-dimensions of the line-items (which will vary based on user preferences, operating system,  etc.)</p>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The Location Indicator should update in real-time, with no full-page (or even full-table) refresh necessary.

But in shorter intervals, it is sufficient to just show the table grid empty and have it progressively filled in. </p>

<h3><a name="9.6.5" id="9.6.5"></a>9.6.5 Table Controls Drawer</h3>
<h2 class="level1"><img 
 src="tables_graphics/table_controls.png"></h2>

  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the user presses the Table Controls button, a drawer should open with additional table controls, and the button should turn blue. The drawer should open progressively using AJAX so it appears to slide open. 
    </li>
</p>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When the user presses the Table Controls button again, the drawer should progressively slide closed and the button should turn back to silver. 
    </ul>
</p>
<p><span class="requirement">The purpose of this drawer is to keep the table presentation simple, and keep the focus on the data rather than the controls, when the user does not need them. Moreover, if there are no table controls applicable to the situation, the entire drawer goes away, along with the Table Controls button. </span></p>
<p>All table controls are context-applicable and optional and inclusion of each should be developer-specified by parameter. They fall into four groups: Filter, Export (more may be added in this section in a later release),  Columns and Multiple Sort. Export opens a dialog box on top of the page, while Custom Filter (from the Filter dropdown), Columns, and Multiple Sort slide open panels below.  Each if these features will be discussed further below. <br>

<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> The one control directly in the controls drawer is the table filter. This is the equivalent of the  Filter control in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.1.1">9.5.1.1 Basic Table Filtering</a>, and operates the same way, <em>except that: </em></p>

  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The filter indication wording on the table title bar is shortened a bit in the AJAX table. The phrase '- Filter: "[Filter Name]" ' is added to the title as shown above. This is especially important in the AJAX table, as the panel can be closed, and the filter field will become hidden. <br>

  <h3><a name="9.6.7" id="9.6.7"></a>9.6.7 Custom Filter </h3>
  <p><span class="level1"><span><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> </span></span>Custom Filtering in the AJAX table operates the same way as the custom filter in standard tables, as discussed in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.1.2">9.5.1.2 Custom Table Filtering</a>, but with some additional features over the version in the standard tables. </p>
  <p class="level1"><img 
 src="tables_graphics/table_search.png"></p>
  <p>Custom Filter is composed of one or more <i>criteria</i>, that determine which objects are to be displayed. The user can add [ + ] a new criterion, or subtract [ - ] an existing one. </p>
<ul class="recommendation">
  <p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> The 'Add a Criterion' control [ + ] should appear below the list of existing items. The subtract control appears for all criteria, unless there is only one criterion left: then it is disabled.</li>
  <p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Criteria may be 'OR'-ed together by the user selecting 'Match All the Following' or 'AND'-ed together by the user selecting 'Match Any of the Following' in a radio button set at the top. 'Match All the Following' should be the default selection.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Criteria should be specific to an attribute's type: for example, the selections for a time-based attribute would be different than those for an attribute with bounded values, such as Hardware Health. See more detail in <a href="09-tables.html#9.6.7.1">9.6.7.1 Defining a Criterion</a>, below.
  <p>If possible, we should permit new 
types of criteria to be developed and plugged in (as well  as permitting localized versions that may not necessarily use left-to-right "natural language" constructs such as those pictured above). </li>

<h4><a name="9.6.7.1" id="9.6.7.1"></a>9.6.7.1 Custom Filter Interaction</h4>

  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Selecting 'Custom Filter...' from the Filter dropdown will open the Custom Filter panel. Like the table controls drawer, the panel should open smoothly and progressively. 
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If another table controls panel is open when Custom Filter is selected, that other controls panel should smoothly slide closed before opening the Custom Filter panel. (This should actually provide a fun animation to watch, as long as it does not take too long.) The values in that other panel should remain as they were for when the panel is next open, not acted upon or discarded. 
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> OK should be a primary button. When the user presses the OK button, it will limit the rows in the table to those matching the criteria. The Custom Filter panel should  automatically slide smoothly closed,  and the Filter dropdown should change to &quot;Custom Filter Applied&quot;.
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> If the user presses the Reset button, it should reset all the fields -- clearing the text fields and setting everything back to the original presentation and the panel should be left open. 
    </li>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> If the user presses Cancel, or changes the Filter control to a predefined filter or &quot;All Items&quot;, the panel should smoothly close without taking any further action.
  The Filter field returns to its setting before the user selected  'Custom Filter...' from the Filter dropdown. If Reset was pressed, and then Cancel was pressed instead of OK, no change to the table or Custom Filter occurs.
  <p> After pressing OK: </p>
  <span><img

  </span>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> After the Custom Filter is done, and continuing while any Custom Filter criteria are in effect, the Filter field should change to showing "(Custom Filter Applied)". </li>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Also, the table title changes to reflect a Custom Filter in effect-- especially important for if the table controls drawer is closed. The phrase "- Custom Filter Applied" is added to the table title as shown above. (Unlike Filter, we will not try to show in the title bar what exact filter was done as it could be very long to concatenate the values.)</li>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> If the Custom Filter panel is closed, the user can clear the Custom Filter by using the filter field to select "All Items" or a predefined filter. </li>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The last Custom Filter values should automatically be saved in the table component, so even after the user goes back to seeing all rows or a predefined filter, they can still return to "Custom Filter... " in the Filter field, and have the last used values defaulted in the fields. These will be discarded when the user leaves that page or logs off, however. </li>
  <p>Additionally, developers can add a "Save Custom Filter As..." button as shown. The developer will provide this functionality if needed, and the Custom Filter will be saved as an option which the user can select elsewhere in the UI and bring up this table with that Custom Filter in place. </li>

          <b>Bounded-value attributes on an ascending (or descending) scale</b> This is similar to the above, except the bounded range of possible values has some natural order or progression to it, and one could say that value <i>x</i> is greater or less than value <i>y</i>. An example is 'Health', where the possible values are 'Good', 'Bad' and 'Failing.'

<img src="tables_graphics/table_multisort.png" height="510" width="662"></p>

  <p>The multiple column sort panel works identically to the one in standard tables, as documented in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.2">9.5.2.2 Multiple-Column Sort Panel</a>, except that:
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. In addition to the OK and Cancel buttons, there will be a Reset button. This Reset button takes the place of the Clear Sort icon used in standard tables (<a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.3">9.5.2.3 Natural Sort Order and Clearing Sorts</a>).   </p>
    <p>2. In order to avoid the confusing term &quot;Tertiary Sort Column&quot;, the second and third sorts have been relabeled &quot;Second Sort Column&quot; and &quot;Third Sort Column&quot;. The primary sort is still labeled &quot;Primary Sort Column&quot; to convey  how these values relate together. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> The descriptive tooltip on the Ascending/Descending dropdown should continue to be used, as described in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.2.2">9.5.2.2 Multiple-Column Sort</a>.
  <p> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Like the Table Controls button, the Multiple Sort... button will change to blue when its panel is opened. Pressing it a second time, will put the Multiple Sort... button back to its standard gray color, and close the panel. Like the Custom Filter panel, the Multiple-Sort panel should open smoothly and progressively, and close the same way.
</li>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If another table controls panel is open when Multiple Sort... is selected, that other controls panel should smoothly slide closed before opening the Multiple Sort panel. (This should actually provide a fun animation to watch, as long as it does not take too long.) The values in that other panel should remain as they were for when the panel is next open, not acted upon or discarded.    
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When the user presses OK, the panel should  automatically slide smoothly closed,  the Multiple Sort... button should return to its standard gray color,
    
and the sort order shown should update on the table.   
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When the user presses Reset, it should reset the fields to the sort which had been in effect when the panel was opened. (If there was no sort in effect when the panel was opened, reset the left column dropdowns to &quot;None&quot; and the right column dropdowns to &quot;Ascending&quot;.) However, the panel will remain open, for the user to check this is what they want, and possibly make additional changes. Only when OK is pressed should this reset column set overwrite the last saved custom one, and only then should the table itself be modified. 
  
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> When the user presses Cancel, the panel should smoothly close without taking any action, and the Multiple Sort... button should return to its standard gray color.
    </li>
If Reset was pressed, and then Cancel was pressed instead of OK, no change to the table sort occurs. 
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Unlike with Custom Filter, only columns currently shown should be included in the sort column dropdowns. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="9.6.11" id="9.6.11"></a>9.6.11 Spanning Headers</h3>
<p><img 
 src="tables_graphics/spanningHeaders.png" ></p>
<p>Spanning Headers will work similarly to standard tables, as shown near the bottom of <a href="09-tables.html#9.1.2">9.1.2 Table Characteristics</a>. If there are 2 or more columns which form a subset group, or are variations on a type of value, they can be grouped together under a spanning column header.  This just shows the different appearance in the AJAX table. <br>
</p>
<h3 ><a name="9.6.12" id="9.6.12"></a>9.6.12 Table Tips </h3>
<img 
 src="tables_graphics/table_tip.png" >

  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the user clicks the Table Tips button, a panel should open with table tips, and the button should change to blue. The panel should open progressively using AJAX so it appears to slide open. </li>
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> If the table controls drawer is open when Table Tips is clicked, the controls drawer (and any panels open from it) should smoothly slide closed before opening the Table Tips panel. </li>
(This should actually provide a fun animation to watch, as long as it does not take too long.)
  <p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the user presses the Table Tips button again, or clicks Close, the Table Tips panel should progressively slide closed and the button should turn back to silver. If the table controls drawer and possibly panels on it had been open before, they should be restored to the open state they were in previously, again sliding open smoothly. This will keep the Table Tips button from being destructive and losing where you were when inadvertantly clicked. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The exact text shown in the table tips panel above may change later, and should be just considered preliminary for now. <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="9.6.13" id="9.6.13"></a>9.6.13 Grouped Tables </h3>
<p><img
 
 src="tables_graphics/grouped_table2.gif"></p>
<p>Grouped Tables will work similarly to standard tables, as described in <a href="09-tables.html#9.5.7">9.5.7 Grouped Tables</a>.  However:</p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> Each group opens and scrolls independently. If a group is closed, no scrollbar or column header set for it is shown (as shown for Flagged Messages above). When a group is opened, a scrolling area is opened along with column headers above it, making the total table height taller. </p>
<p><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"></span> The height of each group's table should be a maximum fixed size (shortened to fit if the number of rows -- plus the footer, if any -- is less than that maximum). That maximum (shown as 5 lines above) should at least be developer-specified, and may be changeable by a user preference.</p>
