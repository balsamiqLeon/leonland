<h1 class="style3"><a name="11"></a> 11 Contextual Help</h1>


<p class="style3">The best way to help users is to provide a
well-designed, easily-understood
 user interface (UI), one in which users can complete most
 tasks without assistance.  However, even in a well-designed
 UI, you might need to display supplementary information
known as "contextual help," commonly called just "help&quot;.
For example, help displayed in a pop-up window or next to some key fields might assist
new users in completing a complex page of your application.
Contextual help assists users immediately, without
requiring that they leave the context of their work.</p>
<p class="style3">For additional information about writing online help, see <a href="01-introduction.html#1.4.5">1.4.5 Content Page Titles and Other UI Text</a>.</p>
<p class="style3">Applications can display help
 in the following ways:
                  
</p>






<ul class="style3">







   <li>Inline with the application's fields and controls</li>
   <li>In the left pane of a wizard or other pop-up window</li>
   <li>In a window dedicated to displaying help (often called "online help")</li>
   <li>In a tool tip</li>   
</ul>








                  
<p class="style3">This chapter describes these types of help, explains when each is appropriate, 
and provides guidelines for creating them.
</p>








<p class="style3">The types of help that are appropriate for a particular window depend on the 
  window's type and the type of page that the window displays. To learn about 
  window types and page types, see <a href="03-windows-pages.html">Chapter 3, Windows and 
  Pages</a>.&nbsp; </p>







                  
<h2 class="style3"><a style="text-decoration: line-through;" name="11.1">
</a>11.1 Inline Help</h2>








<p class="style3">If users might not understand certain UI elements on a page, 
you can provide "inline help&quot;. Inline help consists of instructions, explanations, or links that display 
directly with the page's other elements.  The following example shows inline help 
on a page.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/helpsamplepage.png" alt="Inline help figure" style="width: 725px; height: 199px;"> 
</p>







          
<p class="style3">As shown in the preceding example, inline help can consist of:
</p>








<ul class="style3">







   <li>Page inline help--Brief instructions for completing a page or a section of a page. Also known as "instructional inline help&quot;.</li>
   <li>Field inline help--A brief explanation of a field, typically an entry field. Also known as "explanatory inline help&quot;.</li>
</ul>









<p class="style3">Inline help provides brief assistance to users, both where they need it and
when they need it. Often, inline help is 
appropriate for windows whose content might confuse most new users or infrequent users.  
Inline help complements an
application's other types of user assistance, for example, 
tool tips, error messages, labels on fields, and help displayed
in pop-up windows. 
Inline help works best when the labels of UI elements, such as fields and controls, are 
descriptive and precise.
</p>








<p class="style3">Note that in the previous example there are also links in the inline help, which
enable the writer to provide additional help. To learn about these links, 
see <a href="11-help.html#11.1.4">11.1.4 Including Links in Inline Help</a>.
                   
</p>






<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.1.1">
</a>11.1.1 Deciding Whether to Provide Inline Help</h3>








<p class="style3">Before adding inline help to an application, you  
need to determine which parts of the application, if any, need inline help.
The following guidelines help you decide whether to provide inline help. 
They also help you provide inline help correctly.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Before completing your UI design, consult a technical writer, 
a UI designer, or both, for ideas on where users might need inline help. 
By finding out early which parts of your design need inline help, you can 
sometimes eliminate that need by relabeling those parts or redesigning them.
Before providing inline help in a page, verify that you cannot redesign the page 
to eliminate the need for inline help.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
For each entry field that requests text, consider providing inline help 
if users might not know the valid format or values for that text.  
In the inline help, list the valid formats,  
 show at least one example value, or do both.  For example, inline help for a password field might be: 
 "Passwords must be at least 10 characters long&quot;.</p>







 
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> In wizards 
and other pop-up windows with help 
in their left pane, add inline help to the right pane only if the left-pane help does not suffice.
For example, left-pane help usually would not suffice if users need help about one or more input fields.
Those fields would need inline help.</p>







 
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Test the usability and accessibility of your inline help. 
If you redesign a page that has inline help, verify that the inline help remains accurate and necessary.<br>
</p>








<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.1.2">
</a>11.1.2 Positioning Inline Help</h3>








<p class="style3">The position of a page's inline help enables users to determine which inline help applies to 
which UI element.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Place 
inline help near the UI elements to which it relates.  Follow these guidelines:</p>









 
<table class="info-table" border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">







  <tbody><tr>
    <th class="style3"><b>Scope of the Inline Help</b> </th>
    <th class="style3"><b>Correct Position</b> </th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td class="style3">An entire page of an application</td>

<td class="style3">The top of the page, directly below 
the title.  Place the inline help in that position even if the page has controls for page actions or has  
jump-to links for navigating to sections of the page. However, inline help is rarely necessary 
before those elements. If
the page has no title, place the inline help directly below the page's masthead. 
      The inline help text can extend all the way from the left to the right margin of the page. <br>
 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="style3">A page section that is titled or otherwise visually separated</td>

<td class="style3">The top of that section, directly below the title
or separator.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="style3">A single entry field</td>

<td class="style3">Directly below the field.</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>








<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.1.3">
</a>11.1.3 Formatting Inline Help</h3>








<p class="style3">Among the factors that affect the usability of inline help is its formatting, especially, its
font face, weight, size, and color. Use the Sun Common UI Component Library (in open source, the Project Woodstock components) to obtain the
correct font style for inline help (see <a href="A-component-library-info.html">Appendix A, Component Library Information</a>).</p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14">
In inline help, use color only to highlight links. (The components for
inline help in the Component Library automatically highlight links,
using color.) For accessibility and other usability concerns, avoid
using:
</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>Italic text</li>
<li>Underlined text that is not a link</li>
</ul>









<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Do not place 
tables or inline images in inline help.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14">
Do not explicitly format the line length or font size of inline help.
If you are using the Component Library to create your inline help, allow the
components to format the help automatically.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In inline help, avoid unnecessary line breaks and other layout techniques that waste vertical space.</p>








<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.1.4">
</a>11.1.4 Including Links in Inline Help</h3>








<p class="style3">One good way to keep inline help brief is to include "inline-help links," which are links within inline help.
Inline help can consist of:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>Just text</li>
<li>Text and one or more inline-help links</li>
<li>A single inline-help link</li>
</ul>









<p class="style3">However, depending on the type of window and page, 
inline-help links might not be appropriate.  For example, inline-help links 
are rarely appropriate in wizards.  
Before inserting links into your inline help, read the
sections of this chapter relating to the type of window and page
that you are working with.</p>







  
<p class="style3">When providing inline-help links, follow these guidelines:</p>








<p class="style3"><a name="More-links"></a><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  In your application's overview of accessibility (see <a href="D-accessibility.html">Appendix 
  D, Accessibility</a>), inform users that links in inline help open a new 
  window. In addition, explain that links to additional help often begin with the word 
  "More".</p>








<p class="style3"><a name="no-bulleted-lists"></a><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In inline help, do not display instructions that consist of
more than three steps. Instead, link to those instructions.  For example, "To set 
the properties of this object, <a href="11-help.html#no-bulleted-lists">follow these instructions</a>&quot;.Also, do not use a vertical list for instructions consisting of fewer than three steps -- just give those instructions inline. </p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
For readability and accessibility, ensure that no two inline-help links are touching each other.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14">  
In inline help, include a link only if that link's target is available whenever your application runs.  For example,
in inline help for a reusable UI component, such as a file chooser, provide a link to a particular help topic only if 
the file containing that topic is always accessible from the user's system.  Provide links to the Web only if you can be
sure that users  have a connection to the Internet at that time. </p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" alt="Implementation Information" title="Implementation Information" height="14" width="16"> 
If you link to a help topic from inline help, insert anchors in that help topic to ensure that the appropriate section 
is displayed at the top of the Help window's content area.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14">  
Do not include links in <a href="11-help.html#11.3">left-pane help</a>.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Provide links in inline help
 only to display information that is too large to display inline. 
 Ensure that each link's label precisely describes that link's target. For example, do not use the label "Help," 
 which is too general.  Instead, use a more specific label, such as "More password requirements&quot;.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In inline help, avoid including links to display just one additional line of text.  Instead, try to fit that additional
text inline.  Alternatively, replace the inline help with a different type of help.  For example, in certain pop-up windows, 
you might replace inline help with left-pane help.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14">
If a passage of inline help is too long, create a title for it, and
then display the title as inline help that links to the relevant help
topic. For example, if a password field had lengthy requirements, you
could provide a link labeled "Password requirements" instead of listing
the requirements inline.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> If 
your inline help includes links to definitions of terms, provide those definitions
  in a glossary.  List that glossary as a first-level heading in the table of contents for your application's online help.
  For an example, see the example Help window in <a href="11-help.html#Help%20window%20example">11.2.1 Layout and Behavior of the Help Window</a>.</p>







  
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  In inline help, when linking from a 
  term to its definition, ensure that the link 
  opens that definition at the top of the target window's text area.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
If a pop-up window has both inline help
and left-pane help, do not include links in the inline help.
Instead, consider either of the following approaches:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>Adding additional information inline or 
  in the left pane</li>
  
<li>Redesigning the window so that it needs 
  less help</li>
</ul>






 


<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  If a link ends a passage of inline help and provides additional information 
  about that passage, place a More graphic (<img src="help_graphics/help_link_arrow.gif" alt="" title="" height="10" width="14">) 
  at the beginning of the link, as shown here: </p>








<span class="style3"><a name="More-Link-screen"></a>
</span>
<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help-snap.png" alt="Example screen showing More-link graphic" style="width: 674px; height: 228px;"> 
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Do not place a More graphic (<img src="help_graphics/help_link_arrow.gif" alt="Graphic showing link to more help." title="" height="10" width="14">) 
before links in a phrase that includes nonlinked text.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
When providing a link that begins with a More graphic (<img src="help_graphics/help_link_arrow.gif" alt="Graphic showing link to more help." title="" height="10" width="14">) 
ensure that the link's label is specific.  Do not use the word "More" alone as a link label.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
For inline-help links, make the link's tool tip as specific as possible.  For example, in 
<a href="11-help.html#More-Link-screen">the preceding figure</a>, the tool tip for the "More on alarm severities" link
might be:

</p>






<blockquote class="style3">Shows more help about alarm severities. (Opens a New Window)</blockquote>

<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Ensure 
that your inline help consists of only text and text links.  Ensure that it does not include buttons or other UI controls.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> In 
inline help, never use the phrase "click here&quot;.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
To provide help on an entry field, do not make the field's label a link.  Instead, provide inline help below that field, 
placing links in the inline help if needed.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> In 
inline help, provide only information that the rest of the UI
cannot, or does not, provide. State only what is not clearly visible or otherwise 
obvious.  For example, for labeled fields, 
provide inline help only to add information that the label cannot convey.</p>







 
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Provide page inline help only if the user's task is not obvious.  Do not provide page inline help  
for each page of your application merely to achieve consistent appearance.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  Ensure that mastheads contain no inline help, other than the Help link in main window  
  mastheads. For more information about main window mastheads, see <a href="04-masthead.html">4.1 Main Window Masthead</a>.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Ensure that 
your application's inline help is localizable, accessible, and grammatically correct. For accessibility, follow the guidelines in <a href="D-accessibility.html">Appendix D, Accessibility</a>.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Use sentence capitalization for all inline help.  <span style="">For more information, see
 </span><a href="02-visual.html#2.5" style="">2.5 Text Capitalization</a><span style="">.</span> When referencing 
objects on the page, button names, for example, match their capitalization.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> When writing 
instructions, start with what the reader can do, and then describe how to do it.  For example:
</p>






<blockquote class="style3">"To stop the print job, click Stop."</blockquote>









<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
When punctuating inline help, follow these guidelines:</p>








<p class="style3">
</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>Do not precede inline help with an asterisk or other punctuation.  One exception is inline help intended 
to inform users that, in the UI, required fields are marked with an asterisk-like icon.</li>
<li>Do not enclose an entire passage of inline help in parentheses, brackets, braces, or quotation marks.</li>
</ul>









<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
When providing inline help, 
limit its length by following these suggestions:</p>








<table class="info-table" border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">







  <tbody><tr>
    <th class="style3"><b>Scope of the Inline Help</b> </th>
    <th class="style3"><b>Recommended Length</b> </th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td class="style3">An entire page of an application</td>

<td class="style3">One to three short sentences</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="style3">A page section that is titled or otherwise visually separated</td>

<td class="style3">One short sentence</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="style3">A single entry field</td>

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="style3">One short sentence or, preferably, one phrase</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In instructions, use the imperative whenever possible.


</p>






<blockquote class="style3"><b>INCORRECT</b>: You can stop the print job by clicking Stop.</blockquote>








  
<blockquote class="style3"><b>CORRECT</b>: To stop the print job, click Stop.</blockquote>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Use 
precise verbs.  For example, do not use "specify" if "choose," "type," or some other verb is clearer.  In addition, use the verb "select" only where 
it is not ambiguous.  In UIs, "select" is not an exact synonym for "choose&quot;.  
"Select" means "to designate one or more UI objects, typically for a subsequent action&quot;. For example, a user might 
select several files so that they can all be moved as a set. In contrast, a user might choose a command from a menu.
Choosing a menu command does not designate it for a subsequent action, so "choose" is the correct verb.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Do not 
abbreviate "that is" and "for example" as "i.e&quot;. and "e.g."  Spell out those terms, or, better yet, omit them.  
If a passage of inline help consists solely of examples, listed in a series, then start the passage with the word 
"Examples," followed by a colon and a space character, as shown here:

</p>






<blockquote class="style3">Examples: AND, OR, NOT</blockquote>








<h2 class="style3"><a name="11.2"></a>
  11.2 Help-Window Help</h2>








<p class="style3">Not all help is brief enough to display on the page where users perform their task.
To display more help, applications can open the Help window, as described 
in the following sections.</p>








<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1"></a>
  11.2.1 Layout and Behavior of the Help Window</h3>







  
<p class="style3">The Help window is a pop-up window that opens and displays help when users click:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







    <li>Links in inline help</li>
    <li>The Help link in the main window masthead</li>
  
</ul>









<p class="style3">Here is an example of the Help window:</p>








<span class="style3"><a name="Help window example"></a>
  
</span>
<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help6-flat.png" style="width: 1040px; height: 522px;" alt="Help window example" title=""></p>








<p class="style3"><b>Note:</b> In this chapter's examples of the Help window, the help topics are intended only 
  to show the window's UI elements. The topics are not necessarily from actual Sun products.
</p>






<p class="style3">

</p>






<p class="style3">After the Help window first opens, it stays open until
a user explicitly closes it.</p>






  
<p class="style3">Users can minimize the Help window. If a user minimizes the Help window, 
the Help window is restored when the user either:</p>








<p class="style3">
</p>






<ul class="style3">







    <li>Explicitly restores it</li>
    <li>Requests online help from any application that uses the Help window</li>
  
</ul>









<p class="style3">To understand the Help window better, you might need information on the following topics:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







    <li>Links in inline help, described in <a href="11-help.html#11.1.4">11.1.4 Including Links in Inline Help</a></li>
    <li>Main windows and pop-up windows, as described in <a href="03-windows-pages.html">Chapter 3, Windows and Pages</a></li>
    <li>The main window masthead, described in <a href="04-masthead.html#">4.1 Main Window 
      Masthead</a></li>
  
</ul>









<p class="style3">For information on how to provide Help-window help correctly, see <a href="11-help.html#11.2.2">11.2.2 Providing Access to Help-Window Help</a>.</p>









<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Ensure that your application displays only one Help window. 
For example, in a main window, a user might click the masthead's Help link, navigate to another page of the application 
without closing the Help window, and then click the masthead's Help link again. The help for 
that new page should be displayed in the existing Help window.</p>








<h4 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1.1"></a>
  11.2.1.1 Anatomy of the Help Window</h4>








<p class="style3">The Help window has the following parts, starting from the top:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







    <li>Window title bar</li>
    
    <li>Content area, divided into three panes:</li>
       <ul>
       <li>The content-area title pane, which spans the two lower panes</li>
       <li>The navigation pane (the left pane)</li>
       <li>The topic pane (the right pane), which displays a horizontal toolbar above a text area</li>
       </ul>
  
</ul>









<p class="style3">As shown in <a href="11-help.html#Help%20window%20example">the preceding example</a>, the Help window's navigation and 
topic panes are separated by a moveable vertical divider.  
The divider enables users to widen one pane while narrowing the other, 
without affecting the window's overall width.<br>
</p>
<p class="style3">The X at the top right of the
window, and the Close button at the bottom right, both provide the same
function, to close the window.<br>
</p>









<h4 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1.2"></a>
  11.2.1.2 Sizing of the Help Window</h4>








<p class="style3">When the Help window is initially displayed, it is 750 pixels wide and 500 pixels tall, but users can resize the window.
If a user resizes the Help window, the window behaves as follows:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>The individual heights of the window title bar and content-area title pane remain static.  
However, the width of each of those elements changes, always spanning the entire width of the Help window.<br></li>

<li>The height and combined width of the navigation and topic panes change with that of the 
entire Help window.  In addition, as the size of the Help window changes, the widths of these two panes 
stay in the same left-to-right ratio.  By default, that ratio is about 1:2.  In other words,
the left pane spans about one third of the Help window's width.
Regardless of size, the navigation and topic panes  are always of equal height.</li>
</ul>









<h4 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1.3"></a>
  11.2.1.3 Window Title Bar in the Help Window</h4>







  
  
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
    In the Help window, ensure that the window title bar conforms 
    to the guidelines for pop-up windows. For more information, see 
    <a href="03-windows-pages.html">Chapter 3, Windows and Pages</a>.</p>







  

<h4 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1.4"></a>
  11.2.1.4 Content-Area Title Pane in the Help Window</h4>







  

<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In the Help window, ensure that the content-area title pane contains only the content area's title, which is "Help&quot;.  
In addition, ensure that the title is text, not a graphic, so that it can be translated.</p>







  
<h4 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1.5"></a>
  11.2.1.5 Navigation Pane in the Help Window</h4>







  
<p class="style3">The navigation pane is a tabbed pane with tabs labeled as follows, in left-to-right order:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







    <li><b>Contents</b> (Required)--Displays the table of contents (TOC) for the application's set of help topics</li>
    <li><b>Index</b> (Required)--Displays an index of the application's set of help topics</li>
    <li><b>Search</b> (Required)--Enables users to search for help topics that contain a user-specified string</li>
    
</ul>









<p class="style3"><b>Note:</b>The tabs of the Help window's navigation pane differ visually from tabs described elsewhere in these Guidelines 
(see <a href="05-navigation.html#5.2">5.2 Tabbed Panes Details</a> for more information).
</p>




<span class="style3">
<!-- NOTE NOTE NOTE:

Making the Index and Search tabs optional did not make it into 2.1 component, so the following paragraph

was commented out, and the (Optional)'s changed to (Required)'s for these tabs in the list above. -->
<!-- <P>In applications where the Help window provides 

neither an index nor a search feature, the navigation pane is not tabbed.  Instead, information

that would be on the Contents tab is displayed directly in the navigation pane.

</P> -->







</span>
<p class="style3">If the navigation pane's content extends beyond the pane, 
horizontal scrollbars, vertical scrollbars, or both are displayed in the pane.
Text in the navigation pane does not wrap. Therefore, try to name navigational elements to avoid these scrollbars.</p><p class="style3"><b>Contents Tab:</b> <br><br>
The Contents tab is the far-left tab of the Help window's navigation pane. By default, the Contents tab 
is the pane's active tab, as shown in <a href="11-help.html#Help%20window%20example">the preceding example</a>.  
Within the Contents tab, applications display their Table of Contents (TOC) as a collapsible navigation tree. 
Each node of the tree includes a text link to a help topic.  Users can display that topic
in the Help window's topic pane by clicking the link.  If a user clicks a link in the TOC, the Help window 
highlights that link's node in the TOC and displays the link's target (the text of a help topic) in the topic pane (the 
right pane).</p>








<p class="style3">In the TOC, all container nodes are open by default.  (Container nodes in the contents tab contain subtopics.) However,
users can close each container node individually by clicking that node's navigation control.
</p>








<p class="style3">Unlike nodes in typical navigation trees, nodes in a TOC have no graphic.
Another difference between a TOC and typical navigation trees is that the
background color of a TOC is white, as shown in <a href="11-help.html#Help%20window%20example">the preceding example</a>.
For more information about container nodes, see 
<a href="05-navigation.html#5.1.4">
5.1.4 Tree</a>.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14">
Divide help into multiple topics. Include each major topic, with its subtopics, in its own container node.
</p>







  
<p class="style3"><b>Index Tab:</b> <br><br>

The Index tab is the middle tab of the Help window's
navigation pane, as shown in the following example:
</p>








<span class="style3"><a name="index-example-screen"></a>
</span>
<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help_IndexTab.png" alt="Help Window With Index Tab" style="width: 844px; height: 523px;">  
</p>








<p class="style3">The Index tab enables users to:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







 <li>View and navigate an index

 </li><li>Choose an index entry, thereby displaying the corresponding
     help topic in the the Help window's topic pane (the right pane)
</li>
</ul>








<p class="style3">Typically, the only help topics indexed are for the application from which the Help window was opened.
</p>








<p class="style3">The Index tab is inactive until a user clicks it, making it the active tab.
Activating the Index tab or deactivating it does not affect the Help window's topic pane.
</p>








<p class="style3">The Index tab displays an index as a navigation tree. Each node of the tree 
is either:
</p>








<ul class="style3">







 <li>A container node - An index entry with subentries</li>
 <li>A leaf node - An index entry without subentries</li>
</ul>








<p class="style3">In indexes, all container nodes are open by default.  However,
users can close each container node individually by clicking that node's navigation control.
</p>








<p class="style3">Unlike nodes in typical navigation trees, nodes in indexes have no graphic.
Another difference between indexes and typical navigation trees is that the
background color of indexes is white, as shown in <a href="11-help.html#index-example-screen">the preceding example</a>.
For more information about container nodes, see 
<a href="05-navigation.html#5.1.4">
5.1.4 Tree</a>.
</p>








<p class="style3">Indexes have vertical and horizontal scrollbars, but only if the index is longer or wider than the navigation pane.</p>
<span class="style3">The index entry is highlighted when the user clicks the link, and the associated help topic is 
displayed.  









</span>
<p class="style3">After a user clicks an index entry, thereby displaying the 
corresponding help text in the topic pane, that text remains displayed 
until the user either:
</p>








<ul class="style3">







  <li>Clicks a different index entry</li>
  <li>Displays a different help topic by using the Help window's Contents tab, Search tab, or 
      a link in the window's topic pane</li>
</ul>







<p class="style3">
If a user switches among the tabs, the highlighted selection in the navigation pane is 
removed, so there is no conflict between what is selected in the tab and what is displayed in 
the topic pane.  For example, if a user clicks an item in the index (and displays its topic) and then 
switches to the Table of Contents, the Table of Contents  would have no highlight when initially displayed.
</p>







<p class="style3">
Maintaining an appropriate selection (with highlighting) when switching tabs is something that might 
be addressed in a future release of the guidelines and this component.
</p>









<p class="style3"><b>Search Tab:</b> <br><br>

The Search tab is the far-right tab of the Help window's navigation pane, as shown in the following example:
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help_SearchTab_dflt.png" alt="Help Window With Search Tab" style="width: 844px; height: 523px;">  
</p>








<p class="style3">The Search tab enables users to type a query and then view 
the titles of help topics whose full
text contains matches for that query.  The only topics searched are
those of the application from which the Help window was
opened.
</p>








<p class="style3">As shown in the preceding example, the UI elements of the Search tab are:</p>








<ul class="style3">







 <li>Search input field and Search button</li>
 <li>Inline help for the input field</li>
 <li>Results text area</li>
</ul>








<p class="style3">A horizontal rule separates the Results text area from the UI elements above it.
</p>








<p class="style3">The Search tab is inactive until a user clicks it, 
making it the active tab.
Activating the Search tab does not affect the Help window's
topic pane (the right pane).
However, if a user clicks a link in the Search tab, the corresponding help text
is displayed in the topic pane, as shown in the following example:
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help_SearchTabESM.png" alt="Search Tab With Results" style="width: 844px; height: 523px;">  
</p>








<p class="style3">The link that the user clicks can be either:</p>








<ul class="style3">







 <li>The Search input field's inline help link</li>
 <li>A link in the list of results returned from the user's search query</li>
</ul>








<p class="style3">  
On the Search tab, links are the only UI controls that affect the 
Help window's topic pane.</p>








<p class="style3">The Search input field is where users type their query. 
The Search input field is blank until a user starts typing in it. 
If a user's query is too long to display in the input field, the
query scrolls to the left as the user types.  If
the user moves the cursor back, the query scrolls
to the right when the cursor reaches the left
border of the input field.
</p>








<p class="style3">The Search input field has no visible label but does have an HTML title attribute for 
accessibility.  The value of that title attribute is
"Search input field&quot;. For more information about the HTML title 
attribute, see the description of it on the World Wide Web Consortium's 
web site at:</p>








<p class="style3">
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#adef-title">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#adef-title</a>
</p>







   		  
<p class="style3">The Search input field's inline help
consists of a link labeled "Tips on Searching&quot;. Clicking the link 
opens the corresponding help text in the topic pane, as shown in the following example:</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help_SearchTab_Tips.png" alt="Help Topic for Search Input Field" style="width: 844px; height: 523px;">  
</p>







<p class="style3">
  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" alt="Implementation Information" title="Implementation Information" height="14" width="16"> The inline help link's corresponding help text is
not a "help topic" in the strict sense.  It is not included in the 
Help window's table of contents or in the results of queries.
</p>







<p class="style3">Directly to the right of the Search input field is a
right-justified command button labeled "Search&quot;.  Clicking the Search button performs the  
search. Users can also perform a search by pressing Return or Enter while input focus 
is in the Search input field.</p>








<p class="style3">If a user clicks the Search
button while the Search input field is empty, a message is displayed directly 
in the Results text area, top justified. That message
is "The search found no results&quot;.  The same 
message is displayed if no help topics match the 
query that a user types, as shown in the following example:</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/help_SearchTab_no_results.png" alt="Search Tab With No Results" style="width: 844px; height: 523px;"> 
</p>








<p class="style3">If one or more help topics match the user's query, 
 the titles of those
topics are listed in the Results text area, which occupies the remaining
portion of the Search tab.</p>









<p class="style3">Until a user performs a first query, the Results text area is blank.
If the user performs a query for which there are matches:</p>








<ul class="style3">








  <li>The Results text area lists the titles of the help topics
  that match the user's query.
  
  </li><li>The titles are listed in order by their relevance to the user's query, 
  from the most likely matches to the least likely ones. The only visible sign 
  of the ranking is the order of titles in the list.</li>

</ul>








<p class="style3">Each title in the list is a link.  Clicking a title
displays the corresponding help topic in the Help window's 
topic pane.  Except
for clicking the title of a help topic or clicking a link
in inline help, user actions performed in the Search tab do
not affect the Help window's topic pane.</p>








<p class="style3">Search results remain displayed 
until a user performs a subsequent search.  The same is true of messages
displayed in the Results text area.
Search results and messages remain displayed even if a user deactivates 
the Search tab and then reactivates it. To deactivate the 
Search tab, users activate the Contents tab or the
Index tab.</p>








<p class="style3">The Results text area displays vertical and horizontal scrollbars but
only when the list of titles is longer or wider than the
text area.</p>








<h4 class="style3"><a name="11.2.1.6"></a>
  11.2.1.6 Topic Pane in the Help Window</h4>







  
<p class="style3">The topic pane consists of a horizontal toolbar pane above a text area,
as shown in <a href="11-help.html#Help%20window%20example">the preceding example</a>.  The toolbar pane 
never scrolls; it always remains visible in the window.</p>








<p class="style3">The toolbar buttons are, from left to right:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>Back--Displays the help topic most recently displayed</li>
<li>Forward--Displays the next topic in a series of topics that the user displayed</li>
<li>Print--Prints the currently displayed help topic</li>

</ul>









<p class="style3">These buttons are all icons. <br>
</p>








<p class="style3">The following table shows the tool tip for each button:</p>








<table class="info-table" border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">







  <tbody><tr>
    <th width="93" class="style3"><b>Button Name</b> </th>
    <th width="149" class="style3"><b>Tool Tip</b> </th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td class="style3">Back</td>

<td class="style3">Go Back </td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="style3">Forward</td>

<td class="style3">Go Forward </td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="style3">Print</td>

<td class="style3">Print</td>

</tr>

</tbody></table>
<span class="style3"><br>
</span>
<p class="style3">If the text pane's content is longer than the text pane, 
vertical scrollbars are displayed in the text pane as needed.  If the content is wider than the text pane, 
text wraps to the pane's current width. If graphics  extend 
beyond the pane, the pane displays horizontal scrollbars as needed. 
</p>








<p class="style3">
The topic pane is never blank.  It always displays a user's most recently chosen page until 
the user requests a different page and that new page is displayed.  When the Help window first opens, 
the topic pane displays the page associated with the link that opened the Help window.
</p>

  11.2.2 Providing Access to Help-Window Help</h3>







<p class="style3">
When providing access to Help-window help, follow these guidelines:<br>
<br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In main windows, ensure that the masthead's Help link opens 
the Help window and displays information specific to the main
window, typically about its content area.  For information about 
the content area of windows, see <a href="03-windows-pages.html">Chapter 3, Windows and Pages</a>.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
When writing a help topic about a particular page of an application, keep in mind that users might not have
that page displayed while reading the help topic.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In main windows with tabs or panes, ensure that the masthead's
Help link is context-sensitive to the user's current tab or pane. 
If necessary, place anchors in your help file so that you can 
link directly to sections about each tab or pane.

  11.3 Left-Pane Help</h2>







                  
<p class="style3">Some applications open pop-up windows used as dialog
 pages or wizards. Some of these windows are divided into left and right panes, 
 as shown here:</p>







                  
<p class="style3"><a name="advanced_sort_figure"></a>
</p>

</p>







                
                  
<p class="style3">In these pop-up windows, the left pane can display help about the window.  
Help displayed in this way is called "left-pane help&quot;. 
By default, the left pane, also known as the "help pane," occupies 35 percent of the 
entire window's width. Users can resize the entire window, causing the left and right panes to change
their size while retaining their proportions relative to each other.</p>







                  
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Provide left-pane help only in pop-up windows that display either:

<h2 class="style3"><a name="11.4"></a>
  11.4 Choosing the Correct Type of Help</h2>








  
<p class="style3">You can provide help for your application's pages in one or more of the following ways:
                  
</p>






<ul class="style3">







   <li>Inline with the page's other UI elements</li>
   <li>By way of an inline-help link or a Help link in the page's masthead</li>
   <li>In the page's left pane</li>
   <li>In a tool tip</li>   
</ul>









<p class="style3">This section helps you 
choose the best way to provide help other than tool tips.  For guidance on providing
tool tips, see <a href="11-help.html#11.5">11.5 Tool Tips</a>.</p>








<p class="style3">The best way to provide help depends on factors such as whether: 

</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>The window displaying the page is a main window or a pop-up window</li>
<li>The help is brief</li>
<li>Most users need the help to complete their task</li>
</ul>









<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.4.1"></a>
  11.4.1 Providing Help for Main Windows</h3>








<p class="style3">All main windows have a Help link in their masthead.
That link opens the Help window, as described in <a href="11-help.html#11.2">11.2 Help-Window Help</a>.
Optionally, pages in main windows can include inline help.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Do not provide left-pane help in main windows.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14">  
In main windows where users likely need help, provide an inline-help link to display the same page 
that users can open using the Help link in the masthead. Ensure that the inline-help link's label is descriptive and includes 
the phrase "about this page" or a more specific phrase.  For example, the link's label might be: "For instructions, 
read the help topic about this page&quot;.
</p>








<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.4.2"></a>
  11.4.2 Providing Help for Pop-Up Windows</h3>








<p class="style3">Pages in pop-up windows can include inline help, left-pane help, or both.  
In pop-up windows, no page has a Help link in its masthead.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In pop-up windows, provide help only if users need it.
</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
When providing help for a pop-up window:

</p>






<ul class="style3">







<li>Prefer help displayed directly in the UI 
over help provided by way of a link.</li>

<li>Prefer inline help to left-pane help, except under any of these
conditions:</li>

   <ul>
   <li>The page is a wizard.
   </li><li>The page is long, and new users likely need help on each field.</li>
   <li>The available space is too small for inline help, and inline-help links
   are inappropriate.</li>
   </ul>
</ul>









<h2 class="style3"><a name="11.5"></a>
  11.5 Tool Tips</h2>







                  
<p class="style3">Tool tips are small rectangles of text that provide a short description
 of a UI element or area. On the web, tool tips can be applied to  
elements such as icons, entry fields, and buttons.</p>







                  
<p class="style3">In HTML, tool tips are created by specifying title text for the HTML title attribute.
                 

</p>






<p class="style3">This is how a tool tip, produced with title text,
 would look when the user
 mouses over an image:</p>







                  
<p class="style3">
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<img alt="Title Attribute Text" style="border: 0px solid ; height: 78px; width: 142px;" src="help_graphics/orange.gif" title=""> 
</p>







  
<p class="style3">For more information, see the description of the HTML title attribute on the World Wide Web Consortium's web site at:
</p>








<p class="style3">
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#adef-title">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#adef-title</a></p>







                  
<span class="style3"><strong>Note:</strong> There is a difference between a tool tip, produced with the HTML title
attribute, and alternative text, produced with the HTML alt attribute.
Alt text is required to provide a description of every graphic. It
is imperative that it be present for visually-impaired users who use screen readers.
It is also useful where graphics are not rendered, for
example, when users have image loading turned off. In such situations, Alt
text enables users to selectively download graphics.  


</span>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Use the HTML alt attribute to define Alt text 
for all images, including
 decorative images. Use both the HTML alt  attribute and the HTML title  
 attribute for all interactive graphics 
and for graphics that users might not understand without a description.  For example, any clickable icon  
(such as an alarm icon or a pagination arrow) should have 
both the HTML alt and title attributes set. 
In contrast, the hierarchy lines of a tree control should use only the alt attribute.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  Write the HTML Alt text so that it concisely
 states the function of the image. <br>
</p>







 
  
 <span class="style3">For more information about HTML Alt text, see <a href="D-accessibility.html">Appendix D - Accessibility Requirements</a>.
   

                  
 
 </span>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  Do not use tool tips as a substitute for other forms of 
help.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Provide a tool tip for each button or link that opens a new window. Ensure that the tool tip
ends with this parenthetical phrase: (Opens a New Window). Use headline capitalization for
the parenthetical phrase, regardless of the tool tip's length.

</p>






<blockquote class="style3"><b>EXAMPLE:</b> Print the first column of this table. (Opens a New Window)</blockquote>










<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Provide a tool tip for each icon and graphical button (even those that do not open a new window).</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
In tool tips that begin with a verb, use the imperative form, if possible:

</p>






<blockquote class="style3"><b>USE</b>: Print Table Row</blockquote>








  
<blockquote class="style3"><b>NOT</b>: Prints Table Row</blockquote>









<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
A tool tip for a graphical element should describe that element; it should not provide other
help about an application. The HTML Alt  text for images should reflect that distinction. <br>
</p>







 
<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.5.1"></a>
  11.5.1 Creating Tool Tips</h3>







                  
<p class="style3">In most browsers, tool tips are displayed for only a few seconds. Sighted users need to read a tool tip 
within that brief time.</p>







 
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14">
Keep the length of tool tip text as short as possible. For
accessibility, ensure that no tool tip is longer than 150 characters
when displayed in English.</p>







                  
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14">
To avoid confusion, do not use terms such as "Back," "Home," or
"Forward" in tool tips. An exception is any tool tip for a control that
behaves exactly the same as the browser's control labeled with that
term. </p>








<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.5.2"></a>
  11.5.2 Creating Longer Descriptions Using the HTML longdesc Attribute</h3>







                  
<p class="style3">The HTML longdesc attribute, part of HTML
 4.01 and supported by some browsers, is intended for users who use screen readers. For
elements other than text, you can use the longdesc 
attribute  to provide a longer description than can otherwise be provided
with the HTML alt attribute. However, not all
screen readers recognize the longdesc attribute.
Unlike Alt text, the Longdesc text is presented only when users using a screen reader explicitly request
more information.</p>







                  
<p class="style3">In the following image, the HTML alt attribute is "Disk
 Partitions&quot;. The HTML longdesc attribute refers
 to the file "chart.html," which reads as follows:</p>








<p class="style3">
</p>






<blockquote class="style3">This is a visual indication of the partitioning of a disk. Each 
slice on the disk appears with a width relative to its space on 
the disk. Slice 2 occupies the whole disk. There is some free 
space between slices 1 and 3. Free space appears in white, while 
used space appears in a pink color.</blockquote>








                  
                  
<span class="style3"><a name="longdesc-example"></a><img src="help_graphics/chart.gif" title="Graphic of disk partitions" alt="Graphic of disk partitions" style="width: 424px; height: 119px;">
</span>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  When a short text equivalent does not adequately convey the function 
or role of an image, provide additional information in a file designated
by the HTML longdesc attribute. </p>







 
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Provide the HTML longdesc attribute for an
image if the image conveys information 
that is too long to present by way of  
the HTML alt attribute or the HTML title attribute.
</p>

  11.5.4 A Note on HTML alt and longdesc Attributes for Tree Navigation Objects</h3>







                  
<p class="style3">In tree navigation, turners use HTML Alt text and HTML Title text
to indicate their expanding and collapsing behavior. Since turners convey much 
information about the tree state and interaction possibilities, they 
also use the HTML longdesc attribute to describe
 to screen reader users how to interact with the turners. They also use the 
longdesc attribute to describe the state of 
the tree.</p>







 
<p class="style3">Tree hierarchy lines use the 
 HTML longdesc attribute to indicate their purely visual function. For more information about 
 tree navigation objects, see 
 <a href="05-navigation.html#5.4.2">5.4.2 Tree Look and Feel</a>.</p>







                  
<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.5.5"></a>
  11.5.5 Visual Design Considerations for Tool Tips</h3>







                  
<p class="style3">Some browsers enable users to increase the font size used to display tool
 tips, even without requiring users to change the browser's other font-size 
settings. Long tool tips can become unreadable when displayed in a larger 
font size.</p>







                  
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  When creating text for tool tips, make it as brief as possible.</p>







 
<p class="style3"><a name="tool-tip-caps-guideline"></a>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  Use headline capitalization for short tool tips. Use sentence capitalization
 for longer tool tips. <span style="">See </span><a href="02-visual.html#2.5" style="">2.5 Text Capitalization</a><span style="">.</span></p>

  11.5.6 Tool Tips for Disabled Icons</h3>







                  
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  Make tool tips for disabled icons indicate the disabled state. <br>
</p>







 
<p class="style3">Indicating that an icon is currently disabled is helpful to users. For 
example: "Go to Next Page (Unavailable)&quot;.</p>







                  







<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.5.7"></a>
  11.5.7 Tool Tips for Icons With Alarm Badges</h3>







  
<p class="style3">Icons are sometimes overlayed with a "badge&quot;. A badge is a small graphic superimposed 
  over a corner of an icon, typically to indicate an alarm. Badged icons are often 
  displayed in trees. For more information on badges and alarms, see <a href="05-navigation.html#5.4.2.1">5.4.2.1 
  Alarms</a>.</p>








<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
   If an icon is badged with an alarm (for example, this icon: <img src="help_graphics/badgedicon.gif" alt="Icon badged with an alarm" title="Icon badged with an alarm" height="14" width="14"> ), make its tool tip 
  indicate both the icon's meaning and its alarmed state. Use brackets around 
  the portion of the tool tip that indicates the alarmed state. For example: 
</p>






<ul class="style3">







   <li>Tool tip for an icon without a badge: "Resource Groups: apache-r" </li>
   <li>Tool tip for the same icon when the icon has a critical alarm badge: 
"[Alarm: Critical] Resource Groups: apache-r"</li>
 
</ul>







 
<p class="style3">This is how a tool tip for an icon with a critical alarm badge would appear:</p>







                  
<p class="style3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="help_graphics/badgedicon_illust.gif" alt="[Alarm: Critical] Resource Groups: apache-r" title="[Alarm: Critical] Resource Groups: apache-r" border="0" height="65" width="237">

<h2 class="style3"><a name="11.6"></a>11.6 Pop-Up Bubble</h2>

<p>
The Pop-Up Bubble is a user interface element that allows the end user to see context-sensitive information pertinent to a certain area of the screen. 
The end user hovers (places the mouse pointer) over an object (for example, a label, 
image, or link) for some time, and a pop-up bubble appears with 
additional information that is appropriate to that context. Use the pop-up bubble judiciously, however, so that the pop-up bubbles do not interfere with the user's interaction with the page.
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Avoid a situation where the user is unable to move their mouse without unintentionally opening a bubble. </p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Limit the number of objects  that will generate a bubble to  5 or fewer in a single page.<br>
<br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Display only one pop-up bubble at a time on a given page.</p>
<!-- SOME TEXT AROUND DRAG -N- DROP, BEFORE I KNEW THIS WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED in 4.1.  MIGHT BE USEFUL SOME DAY?
<p class="style5">Although a pop-up bubble will not automatically track mouse movement, it can be dragged to a different location using drag and drop.</p>

<p class="style5"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14">  Move the pop-up bubble when the user drags it to a new location using drag and drop. The user can click on any area within the pop-up bubble that is not a control or a link to initiate the drag and drop. </p>
<p class="style5">After a pop-up bubble is moved, its new location does not affect the position of subsequent pop-up bubble invocations. When a new pop-up bubble is invoked, it is displayed at the appropriate location with respect to the object that the user hovered over. <br>
  <strong><br>
  QUESTION:  I was wondering if the mouse had to be on the pop-up bubble title bar to drag the bubble or if it could be anywhere in the bubble, so I figured I'd try it out in the example app. The ones in the example were not draggable. So the question is - is drag &amp; drop of the bubble goint to be supported in 4.1? And if so, my original question, does the mouse have to drag from the title bar as in regular windows? [OK, I found in the spec that the user does not have to use the title bar area for dragging, but we need to make sure the implementation supports this -- if it is/will be implemented for 4.1.]</strong><br>
  <br>

    <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Include a title bar and left-justified title in the pop-up bubble. The title gives the user some context about the information provided in the pop-up bubble<span class="style5">.<br>
    </span><br>
    If a title bar is included, the following two guidelines apply:
<blockquote>
    <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> <span class="style3">Include a pop-up bubble title that uses headline capitalization. <span style="">See </span><a href="02-visual.html#2.5" style="">2.5 Text Capitalization</a><span style="">.</span></span>
    <p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Include a Close button on the right side of the title bar of the pop-up bubble. This control allows the user to close the pop-up bubble when it is clicked. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Strive for consistency within your application regarding whether or not a title bar and close button are included in pop-up bubbles. <span class="style5"></span><br>
  <br>
  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Place the context-sensitive information in the body of the pop-up bubble. This information must pertain to the object that the user hovered over.<br>
  <br>
A pop-up bubble can contain help information, instructions,  descriptions, details, or any other useful information that pertains to the  object that the user hovered over. The information may be displayed in various formats as well. For instance, the information may be displayed as straight text, label/value pairs, may include images and links, and may even include other user interface elements.</p>
<p class="style3">Because of the different kinds of content that can be contained within a pop-up bubble, this user interface element lends itself to situations where field inline help is not sufficient. Some disadvantages of field inline help are that it is limited to text and links, it should be kept very concise, and it can add clutter to a page. However, field inline help does have some important advantages over the pop-up bubble in that it is always visible and does not require a user action for the user to obtain the information. For these reasons, field inline help should be considered  before deciding to use the pop-up bubble. </p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
Use  field inline help unless the information content cannot be conveyed adequately inline or when using field inline help would clutter the page. In these situations,  the pop-up bubble is a good option for providing the user with context-sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.6.1"></a>11.6.1 Invoking and Closing Pop-Up Bubbles</h3>

To display a pop-up bubble, the user hovers over an object and if a pop-up bubble is available for that object, it will display.
<p class="style3"> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> When additional information is warranted, and field inline help is insufficient, make pop-up bubbles available when the user hovers over text (including labels), links, or images.</p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Display pop-bubbles after the user hovers over an object for 1/2 second.<br>
  <br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Make the size of the pop-up bubble no more than half the size of the main window that it appears over. Typically, however, it will be substantially smaller than that.</p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Do not include scrollbars or allow scrolling in the pop-up bubble.</p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Position the pop-up bubble to the top right of the invoking object. If the bubble will be obscured by the edge of the browser, reposition it to a more suitable location - top left, bottom right or bottom left, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="style3">Below is an example of a pop-up bubble displayed just above and to the right of a link object.<br>
  <br>
<img src="help_graphics/bubble-basic-in-context.png" width="370" height="124"></p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Do not make pop-up bubbles available on components themselves. Make the pop-up bubble available for a component's label instead. For example, make a pop-up bubble available for a text field's label instead of making it available when the user hovers over the text field itself. This way, the availability of a pop-up bubble does not interfere with the interaction of the user with the component. </p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Place a pop-up bubble icon, <img src="help_graphics/bubble-grey.png" width="8" height="7" border="0">, to the top right of labels, links, and other text to indicate that a pop-up bubble is available. When the user hovers over this icon, display the same pop-up bubble that is available for the object.
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
  Images which have bubbles should display the pop-up bubble icon when users would not expect this additional information to be provided (expecting to only find a tool-tip when hovering).</p>
  <p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> If a pop-up bubble is available for a label that is also marked with a required field indicator (see <a href="07-simple.html#7.3.2">7.3.2 Editable Text Fields</a>), place the pop-up-bubble icon before the required field indicator. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="help_graphics/bubble-icon.jpg" width="391" height="187"></p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Continue to display the pop-up bubble as long as the user keeps the mouse pointer within the pop-up bubble or over the object that invoked the bubble. </p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Dismiss the pop-up bubble when any of the following occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="style3">The user moves the mouse pointer off of the invoking object, or outside of the pop-up bubble. In this situation, the pop-up bubble continues to be displayed for a duration of 2 seconds, and then closes.</span></li>
  <li>The user clicks the Close button on the right side of the title bar.</li>
  <li>The user hovers over another object that has an associated pop-up bubble. In this case, the initially displayed pop-up bubble is closed when the new pop-up bubble is displayed.</li>
  <li>The user presses the Esc key.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="style3"><a name="11.6.2"></a>11.6.2 Pop-Up Bubble Content Details</h3>


<span class="style3">A  pop-up bubble is intended to provide context-sensitive information (for example, help, instructions, descriptions, etc.) for the object that the user hovered over. </span>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Do not include large or complex user interface elements such as an add-and-remove element or table within the body of the pop-up bubble. See <a href="08-complex.html">Chapter 8, Complex Elements</a> and <a href="08-complex.html">Chapter 9, Tables</a> for more information about complex elements and tables.</p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Include simple user interface elements within the body of the pop-up bubble when it is appropriate. See <a href="07-simple.html">Chapter 7, Simple Elements</a> for more information about simple user interface elements.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Place a link beginning with &quot;More&quot;  at the end of the pop-up bubble text if the user needs to see more information. When the &quot;More&quot; link is clicked open a new window that presents the additional information. Typically, clicking the &quot;More&quot; link will display  the associated section of the online help.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Phrase the link so that it describes the information the user will get when the link is pressed.  For example, use &quot;More server information&quot; versus simply using &quot;More&quot;.<br>
  <br>
<img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Place a More graphic (<img src="help_graphics/help_link_arrow.gif" alt="" title="" height="10" width="14">) at the beginning of the link, as shown here:</p>
<p class="style3"><img src="help_graphics/bubble-basic-link2.png" width="279" height="125" alt="pop-up bubble with More link">.</p>
<p class="style3">  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Make the &quot;More&quot; link's tool tip as specific as possible. For example, the tool tip for a "More server information " link might be: </p>
<blockquote class="style3">Shows more information about the server. (Opens a New Window)</blockquote>
<p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" height="14" width="14"> 
When the &quot;More&quot; link is clicked, dismiss the pop-up bubble unless the material in the new window that is displayed has content that is needed in conjunction with the information in the pop-up bubble, or if is important for the user to be able to return to the original window with the pop-up bubble still displayed.<br>
  <br>
Enabling the pop-up bubble to remain displayed when a new window is invoked makes it such that upon return to the pop-up bubble, the user cannot simply move the mouse pointer outside of the bubble to close it. The user must explicitly  click the Close button, click outside of the bubble, or invoke another pop-up bubble to dismiss the pop-up bubble. </p>
<p class="style3">  <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline" height="14" width="14"> Use  caution when deciding to keep a pop-up bubble displayed when a new window is invoked. If all pop-up bubbles within a page or application do not behave the same way, the user may notice the inconsistency and it could be confusing.</p>

  <p class="style3"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" alt="Implementation Information" title="Implementation Information" height="14" width="16"> 
To enable the pop-up bubble to remain displayed when a new window is invoked, set the &quot;autoClose&quot; attribute to: autoClose="false".<br>
