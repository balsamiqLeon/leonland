<h1><a name="13"></a>13 Wizards</h1>
<p>This chapter has separate sections for anatomy (<a href="13-wizards.html#13.1">13.1</a>) and 
behavior (<a href="13-wizards.html#13.2">13.2</a>).</p>
<p> A wizard is a series of two or more secondary-content 
pages, each of which corresponds to a step or portion of a step in a user task. 
A wizard leads the user through a task one step at a time, requesting a series 
of responses and finally executing the task based on those responses. Except for 
user responses, a wizard provides all the information needed to do the task. A 
wizard's power comes from its dynamic nature: its ability to present different 
information depending on what is entered by the user in the preceding step. 
Wizards also expedite complex tasks by grouping steps into a single place.<!--StartFragment -->

For sequences of two or more user input steps, 
use a wizard designed according to the guidelines in this chapter. (The Review Selections 
and View Results steps do not count as "user input" steps.)</p>
<p>Note: The&nbsp;guidelines in this chapter are for 
popup wizards only.&nbsp; Guidelines for inline wizards are currently being 
developed and will be available in a later release.&nbsp; If you believe your 
project requires an inline wizard, it must conform to the following three 
guidelines which will be included in an upcoming version.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
  <p>
<img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>Inline wizards may only be used for one or two 
  steps.&nbsp; Anything requiring more than two steps should use the regular 
  popup wizard.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>
<img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>Buttons on the first page must be Next and Cancel,

  Finish and Cancel.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>
<img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>Subtitles should read "My Step Title (Step 1 of 2)" 
  or "My Step Title (Step&nbsp;2 of 2)." </p>
</blockquote>
  
<h2><a name="13.1"></a>13.1 Anatomy</h2>
<p>All wizards have the same basic anatomy. Here is an example picture:</p>
<p align="left"><img style="border: 0px solid ; height: 531px; width: 775px;" alt="Wizard with pointers to the different parts of the Wizard anatomy." src="wizards_graphics/panes_callouts.png" usemap="" title="" hspace="0"></p>
<p align="left"><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"> Spanning the top of the 
  wizard is the wizard title.<br>
  <br><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;The left 
pane contains Help and Steps tabs.&nbsp; <span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255);"><font color="black">The Steps 
tab must be the active (front, foreground) tab by default.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"> If 
there is no Help tab then display the Steps in a non-tabbed format.&nbsp; (Do 
not display a single Steps tab.)&nbsp; See </font>

  <img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;</span></span>Steps must always be displayed in 
the Steps/Help Pane, regardless of the number of steps in the 
wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </font><br>

    The current step's contents appear in the right pane, which 
  is referred to as the <em>content pane</em>.&nbsp; The topmost element in the 
content pane is a subtitle uniquely identifying the step and its purpose.&nbsp; 
The contents of the current wizard step appears below the wizard subtitle.</p>
<p align="left"> <span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255);"><font color="black"><span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255);"><font color="black"><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"></font></span></span>
Format the content pane's subtitle as follows: "Step &lt;step
number&gt;: &lt;current step's text as shown in the steps tab&gt;". For
example, if the step is shown as "1.1 Specify QFS Type", the content
pane's subtitle would be: "Step 1.1: Specify QFS Type". Although the
format changes slightly, the step number and step text remain exactly
the same between the steps tab and the content pane. See the image
above for an illustration of this specific example. </font></span></span></p>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14"> 
 Provide step instructions under the wizard subtitle to give a simple direction for completing the 
current  step. Note that detailed help information is to be placed on the help tab in the left pane.
</p>

<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"> 
      In the example picture above, the Previous button&nbsp;is 
  disabled because <span style="color: #000000;">the current step is</span> the first step in the wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise,&nbsp;the 
  last step has a Finish button instead of a Next button.&nbsp; Middle steps 
  of any&nbsp;wizard display Previous, Next, and Cancel buttons.&nbsp; Follow the guidelines 
  for those buttons, in <a href="07-simple.html#7.1">7.1 Action Buttons</a>.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14"> &nbsp;The content area within 
the wizard should be scrollable, if necessary. The height and width of both 
the&nbsp;left and right panes are set to a percentage of the entire window's 
height and width. If the content of either pane does not fit in the allotted 
space, horizontal&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;vertical scrollbars&nbsp;should appear. The 
scrollbars should appear in the left and/or right panes&nbsp;as needed.&nbsp; 
<font color="black">Scroll bars should not appear if the content displays within 
the default size of the pane.<br>
<br>
</font><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;<font color="black">The following list desc<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">r</span>ibes the sizing of the wizard window:</font> </p>
<ul>
  <li>The default wizard pop-up window size is 400 pixels tall by 600 pixels wide, but can be larger if needed. If you do resize the window, do so proportionately. For example, if you make the wizard 25% taller, you must also make it 25% wider. </li>
  <li>A wizard pop-up window is resizable. If the wizard window is resized, the left pane (help/steps) and the right pane (content area) resize to maintain their original width ratio<s>s</s> of 30 to 70, respectively. </li>
  <li>The wizard window must be smaller than the application's&nbsp;main browser window. </li>
  <li><font color="black">The wizard window&nbsp;should open offset slightly to the right from the center of the screen.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;On wizard steps containing 
multiple entry fields, consider providing a Restore Defaults button. Do not 
provide a Restore Defaults button on pages with only one or two entry fields. 
The button must appear in the content area, above the Previous, Next, Finish, 
and Cancel buttons, not horizontally in line with them. Follow the guidelines 
for those buttons, in <a href="07-simple.html#7.1">7.1 Action 
Buttons</a>.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Do not provide Reset 
buttons in a wizard. This is just one particular case of the general prohibition 
of Reset buttons everywhere, in wizards and non-wizards, secondary content pages and 
primary content pages. </p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;<!--StartFragment -->Allow 
users to perform actions on the data presented in the wizard as long as those 
actions do not take the user out of the wizard.&nbsp;</p>
<p> An&nbsp;example of a type of&nbsp;permissible action is&nbsp;allowing 
users to perform inline actions on objects in tables. The actual action is 
performed by clicking the Next or Finish button (not by making&nbsp;the inline selection). 
Another example of a permissible action is allowing the user to either select 
one of a number of existing objects or to create a new object by entering the 
name of that new object in the wizard. </p>
<p>An example of&nbsp;an impermissible action in a wizard is a "New ..." 
button&nbsp;on a table of objects that would take the user out of the context of 
the task they are currently performing and into the context of creating a new 
object. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Any buttons in addition to 
Previous, Next, Finish, and Cancel, must appear above those buttons in the 
content area, not horizontally aligned with the Previous, Next, Finish, or 
Cancel buttons. An example is the optional Restore Defaults button.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;<font color="black">Use 
headline capitalization for step titles on both the left and right panes.&nbsp; 
Use sentence capitalization for&nbsp;contextual help text, and step 
instructions.</font>   
             
See <a href="02-visual.html#2.5">2.5 Text Capitalization</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Step titles should be

<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;When providing a steps

steps' names in the steps list--previous, current, and future--unless any steps 
branch. "Branch" means that the user's input in a step determines which of&nbsp;several 
sequences of steps will be presented next. "Major step" means a step that has no 
parent step; a major step is any step that is not a substep as defined by <a href="13-wizards.html#13.1.1.1">13.1.1.1 
Branching Represented as Substeps</a>. Follow this decision tree to find out how 
to display branching steps and their subsequent steps:<br></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>For a steps list that does not branch:</b> Display this step's name in the steps list. Do not display any 
  steps as indented substeps of this step. Do not use a placeholder for the next 
  step.<br>
  </li><li><b>For a list of steps that does branch:</b><br><br>
  <ol>
    <li><b>If this is a <i>major</i> step </b>(not a substep), 
    then:<br><b><br></b>
    <ol>
      <li><b>If any branch of this major step has its own branching step (in 
      other words, a sub-substep),</b> then you must represent this <i>major</i> 
      step's branching with the design in <a href="13-wizards.html#13.1.1.2">13.1.1.2 
      Branching Represented as Placeholder</a>. This rule prevents sub-substep representations from 
      occurring. The placeholder design represents the major step's branches as 
      a placeholder for the undetermined steps. The placeholder is replaced by 
      the actual steps after the branch fork is passed--after the branch path is 
      chosen.&nbsp; (You are now done following this decision tree.)<br>

        is preferable to the Placeholder design (see next bullet in this

<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;This design is preferable to 
the placeholder design (<a href="13-wizards.html#13.1.1.2">13.1.1.2 
Branching Represented as Placeholder</a>), and should be sufficient for most 
branching wizards. </p>
<p>    In most cases where a major step branches, you can 
contain the variable steps as substeps of one major step. Substeps appear only 
as needed to accommodate selections made in a previous, branching, major 
step. Grouping these substeps under a&nbsp;parent step allows the user to more easily get an 
overview of the wizard, by displaying only the major steps when the wizard 
is initially displayed. The substeps appear in the steps list only when the user 
passes&nbsp;the branching point. The wizard has a corresponding page in the right pane for 
both major steps and substeps.</p>
<p>     The following 
example sequence of three pictures illustrates the design of the substeps approach 
to handling branching. In the first image, the user selects either the QFS&nbsp;or SAM-FS&nbsp;file system type. 
If the user selects QFS, he must then specify which type of QFS. If the user 
selects SAM-FS, he does not need to specify another filesystem parameter and thus 
no substeps would appear. Therefore, the total number of steps that would appear in 
the left pane cannot be known until the user makes this choice. Using 
substeps allows the wizard to list all of the major steps (the flush left steps, 
numbered 1-7) and still allow for this unknown factor.</p>
<p><img style="width: 635px; height: 475px;" alt="First step in a sequence of three; this one illustrates the beginning of a branch." src="wizards_graphics/wizard_chapter_SubStep1.png" title=""> </p>

<p>In the following picture, the user has selected QFS and has proceeded to 
substep 1.1. In the steps list, that first substep is bold and preceded by the 
arrow glyph.</p>

<p><img style="height: 474px; width: 635px;" alt="Second step in a series of three steps; this one illustrates sub-steps." src="wizards_graphics/Step11_SubSteps2.png" title=""> </p>
<p><font color="#000000">In the</font> following picture, 
because the user has selected "Dual-Allocation," he must then specify which 
percentages to allocate to each disk. Notice that in the list of steps, the 
second substep is now bold and is prefixed with the arrow glyph.</p>

the substeps used to handle a branching major step.</p>

<h4><a name="13.1.1.2"></a>13.1.1.2 Branching Represented as Placeholder</h4>
<p>This design represents each branch in the steps list as a placeholder for the 
undetermined steps before the branch is chosen. The placeholder is replaced by 
the actual steps after the branch path is chosen. </p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">   &nbsp;Use 
the placeholder design&nbsp;only if all of these conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A major step branches. 
  </li><li>The substeps design cannot be used (<a href="13-wizards.html#13.1.1.1">13.1.1.1 
  Branching Represented as Substeps</a>), because the branches diverge even at 
  their ends, or because a substep would itself branch. </li></ul>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;This placeholder design is 
less desirable than the substeps design (<a href="13-wizards.html#13.1.1.1">13.1.1.1 
Branching Represented as Substeps</a>   ), because this 
placeholder design provides the user with less information. The placeholder design is only a 
fallback for use when the substeps design cannot be used.</p>
<p>If a wizard's branch results in two sets of steps that are too divergent to 
be handled by substeps as described in <a href="13-wizards.html#13.1.1.1">13.1.1.1 
Branching Represented as Substeps</a>        
  , display only the current and past steps in the left pane.&nbsp;Display 
a placeholder&nbsp;after the last known step in the list to let the user know that 
additional steps will appear once the fork is passed.</p>
<p>In the following example sequence of two pictures, the Steps tab is displayed 
by default in the left pane. As the user proceeds through the steps, previous and current steps are displayed, followed by 
a placeholder. This placeholder indicates to the user that additional steps will 
appear based on their choice or choices in the preceding step.</p>

<h3><a name="13.1.3"></a>13.1.3 Overview Page</h3><font color="#000000">
<p>    An Overview page provides a brief introduction to the 
wizard and its steps.&nbsp;The Overview page is typically needed only in very complex wizards 
or in wizards that don't immediately display a complete list of steps, but use 
the steps placeholder. Overview pages can help users determine whether a wizard 
meets their needs. In addition, an Overview page can inform users about the 
effects of using the wizard.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14"></font>&nbsp;Use an Overview

<font color="#000000">
<p>Here is an example of an Overview page:</p>

as an unnecessary burden to the user. </p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;The Overview step must be the first step in

<h3><a name="13.1.4"></a>13.1.4 Review Selections Page</h3>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;For wizards with three or more 
user input steps, the Review Selections page is required.</p>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;For wizards with only two user 
input steps, adding a third step for a Review Selections page is optional. If one or 
both of the steps are complex with a large amount of user input, the user might 
benefit from a review of the information they have provided. Conversely, the 
steps might be simple enough that a Review Selections page only adds an unnecessary step.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a Review Selections page on a wizard that contained four user input steps:</p><font color="#000000">
<p align="left"><img alt="Wizard with the Review step displayed." src="wizards_graphics/wizard_chapter_Review.png" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;"> </p></font>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Where it makes sense and 
adds value for the user, display empty values (those for which the user has input 
no data) next to their corresponding labels for user inputs/selections. Do that 
instead of omitting the label of inputs/selections that have been left blank, 
from the display in the right pane of the Review Selections page. Seeing an empty 
value may help 
the user realize they had unintentionally left a field blank.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Make the title of the step "Review 
Selections."</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Include these buttons in the Review 
step: Previous, Finish, and Cancel. When the user clicks the Finish button 
the task begins and the wizard closes or displays the View Results page if a 
View Results&nbsp;step is provided.</p>
<h3><a name="13.1.5"></a>13.1.5 View Results Page</h3>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;The View Results page is an optional 
page that summarizes the work the wizard has performed and lists any actions 
users should take after closing the wizard. For example, the View Results 
page can display an error or warning message, a list of the objects that have 
been updated, or a confirmation that the task has been accomplished.<br></p>
<p>Here is an example of a View Results page for a successfully run wizard: <br></p>

<h2><a name="13.2"></a>13.2 Behavior</h2>
<p>This section of guidelines describes wizard behavior in these basic 
circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="black">Multiple instances of a 
  wizard</font> 
  </li><li>First pass through wizard
  </li><li>User did not backtrack to previous steps with the Previous button
  </li><li>Use of the Cancel button</li>          
</ul>
<center>
<div align="left">
<p>  More complex circumstances are addressed in the following 
sections:</p></div></center>
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.2">13.2.2 Backtracking</a>
  </li><li><a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.3">13.2.3 Finish Button and View Results Page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, the term "validation error" means an error on a user input control on one particular 
step. For example, a wizard for creating an object might have a field 
in which the user must enter a name for the new object, and the user might enter 
a name containing illegal characters.&nbsp;This would cause a validation error.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  The "validation errors"  referenced in these guidelines include malformed individual entries, 
illegal combinations of entries in the same step, and values that 
are illegal based on the value of a previous step. Most required 
input controls require a non-blank, non-null value before they qualify as 
having a valid setting. Some required input controls accept blank or null values 
as valid, but in those cases the blank or null value is one of the choices that 
the user must explicitly make or enter, to distinguish them from the absence of 
user preference for a value. </p>
<p>              
 Optional input controls need not have any value to qualify as valid.&nbsp; If an 
optional control does have a value, that value must be legitimate.&nbsp; The user can 
eliminate a validation error state in an optional control either by removing 
that value and leaving no value, or by changing the value to a legitimate 
one.<br></p>
<h3><a name="13.2.1"></a>13.2.1 Basics</h3>
<center>
<div align="left">
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;<font color="black">Multiple instances of the same wizard should not be 
allowed.&nbsp; If a user tries to launch a wizard that is already in 
progress,&nbsp;switch&nbsp;focus to that&nbsp;existing wizard.&nbsp; If a wizard 
is running, do not disable the button that would launch the wizard but rather 
bring focus to the existing wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--StartFragment --> Disabling the button may 
cause problems as it  <font face="'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif'"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>often&nbsp;becomes difficult to determine when the button should be re-enabled

    </p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Entries made in any step 
may only affect a wizard's future steps, never previous steps. That is, allow 
previous steps to influence later steps, but do not allow later steps to 
influence previous steps. In particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not change the identities or contents of previous steps because the 
  user enters something in a later step. 
  </li><li>Determine
the validity of a user's entry in a step only on the basis of the
entries in that and previous steps. Entries in later steps must not
cause heretofore valid entries in previous steps to become invalid. If
the user makes an entry in the current step, and that entry clashes
with an entry in a previous step, mark only the current step's entry as
invalid. In some cases this may indicate a flaw in the design of the
wizard and the step sequence should be revisited. </li></ul>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Check the validity of 
each input control as soon as the input focus leaves that control, if checking 
at that time makes sense.&nbsp;When it does 
not make sense, defer validity checking until the user clicks that step's Next 
or Finish button. Shifting the input focus away from a control is not a 
foolproof sign that the user thinks that control's value is final. Clicking the 
Next or Finish button is the only foolproof sign. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Check when focus changes, only if that control's value can be validated in 
  isolation from the values of all other controls in that step. That's because 
  the current values in the other controls might not yet be what the user 
  intends. 
  </li><li>Defer checking if the user might want to leave that control's setting 
  partially complete while setting other controls in this or previous steps. 
  Often users take advantage of their random access to all the controls in this 
  and previous steps, to make their settings non-sequentially. 
  </li><li>Defer checking if you are uncertain whether the user thinks they are done 
  making a setting when they shift the focus. </li></ul>
<p>When a wizard has a Review Selections&nbsp;step (which by definition
contains the Finish button), all the user input is known before the
Review Selections&nbsp;step is displayed so all validations and
confirmations should be done before the Review Selections&nbsp;step is
displayed.&nbsp; However, simple two-step wizards&nbsp;may not always
have a Review Selections&nbsp;step. Consequently, they have input
controls on the same page as the Finish button so clicking the Finish
button may be the system's first signal that it is time to validate or
confirm the input.</p>
<p>In some cases the wizard cannot accurately predict 
validity of the input until the wizard's actions actually execute upon the 
Finish button's click. One cause is that the system conditions have changed in 
the time lag between the preliminary validation and the click of the Finish 
button. Another cause is that validation depends on responses from system 
components that cannot respond to hypothetical actions.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">      
     &nbsp;When the user clicks the Next or Finish button 
on a step's page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Immediately check the validity of that step's input, 
  if possible.
  </li><li>If the current step's input controls have validation errors, keep that page displayed 
  while showing the usual validation error messages. Do not proceed to 
  the next page, do not jump to the View Results page, and do not close the 
  wizard. In other words, treat each step page as you would a non-wizard page, 
  following the guidelines in <a href="14-alerts.html#14.2">14.2 JavaScript 
  Alerts</a>, regardless of whether a step page has a Next button or a Finish 
  button. 
  </li>
  <li>If there are no validation errors on that step then either display the next step 
  if the Next button was clicked, or follow the guidelines in <a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.3">13.2.3 Finish Button 
  and View Results Page</a> if the Finish 
  button was clicked.</li></ul>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;When the Next button is 
clicked, do not validation check the next step's page before 
displaying it.</p>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;When the user clicks the&nbsp;Finish button, optionally display an alert to inform them that they are about to 
commit an action that is irreversible, for example, the deletion or 
reconfiguration of an object or objects. Use such an alert with care. 
Understandably, users might be irritated if constantly asked to confirm the same 
actions. In some cases, inline text that informs the user of the impending 
action is sufficient, but usually a JavaScript alert window is more appropriate. 
Follow the guidelines in <a href="14-alerts.html">14 Alerts and 
Messages</a>.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;If the application session 
times out, the wizard window remains open. However, the entire window's contents 
are replaced with a full-page alert telling the user that the session has timed 
out. The full-page alert contains a Close button on the bottom right. This 
guideline for wizards is just one particular case of the more general guideline 
for all pop-up windows. See <a href="03-windows-pages_Popup_Windows.html">3.2 Pop-Up 
Windows</a>.<br>
<br><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;When displaying error 
messages, give users error messages that offer fixes.&nbsp; For example, provide 
an error message with a button for each of the several possible ways for fixing 
the error.&nbsp; If that is not possible, then at least tell users how to fix 
the problems, by offering concrete, specific action advice in error and warning 
messages.&nbsp; For example, tell users exactly which step had the problem, and 
offer suggestions for fixing it. One example of such an error message might 
read, "In step 2, the value you have entered for Capacity is too high to be 
supported by the virtual disks you have selected in step 3. To fix this problem, 
either enter a lower Capacity value in step 2 or select additional virtual disks 
in step 3".

    <font color="#ff0000"><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;When a user selects the Cancel button, display a pop-up 
confirmation only if the wizard is complex enough to warrant concern that data 
might be lost.&nbsp; If the wizard is simple, a pop-up confirmation is not 
necessary.&nbsp; In either case (complex or simple wizards), do not display a 
confirmation if the wizard is closed during the first step.&nbsp; </font></font><br>

<p>This section supplements <a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.1">13.2.1 Basics</a>, 
to cover what happens when the user backtracks to previous steps by clicking the 
Previous button, and moves forward again with the Next button.</p>
<div align="left">
<p>Additional and more complex circumstances are addressed by the later section 
<a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.3">13.2.3 Finish Button

<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;If the user clicks the 
Previous button, display the previous step even if the current step has 
validation error indicators or undetected validation errors. Clicking the 
Previous button does not cause a validation check of the current 
step.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">  &nbsp;Visiting previous 
steps shows those steps with all their values intact from the last visit in this 
session of wizard use, regardless of whether any changes have been made in 
subsequent steps. </p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;User entries are saved from 
page to page. If the user enters information on a wizard's page and clicks Next, 
Previous, or a visited step, then that information on the page being left is 
saved implicitly. <br></p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Changing a previous step's 
values and clicking that step's Next button requires the same wizard 
branching decisions that must be made if this were the first pass through the 
wizard. Consequently, the sequence of the subsequent steps might change. The 
following two guidelines apply to two circumstances:<b><br></b></p>
<ol>
  <li><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;If the previous step's 
  change does <i>not</i> cause the sequence of subsequent 
  steps to change, then the subsequent steps must retain the values they had 
  when last visited, even if those values are now invalid.&nbsp;          
               
        
  <ul>
    <li>Invalid values will be flagged as erroneous as soon 
    as each subsequent step appears (see guideline farther below).<br></li></ul>
  </li><li><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;If instead the previous 
  step's change causes the sequence of subsequent steps to change, consider 
  replacing all the values in those subsequent steps with default values, making 
  this re-traversal unfold as if the user had never before been to these steps. 
  The reversion to default values happens even if the user's previously entered 
  values would still be valid. The reversion begins with the first step whose 
  identity differs from the step that was in that sequence spot before the 
  change. Once a step reverts to its default values, all steps after that one 
  also revert to default values. 
  <ul>
    <li>This recommendation is strongest if the new sequence of steps qualifies 
    as a drastically new context for the user deciding on the values. 
    <ul>
      <li>That can be true even if the component steps of that sequence happen 
      to be the same as before, and so merely are in a different order. The 
      inconvenience of reentering some of the same values is outweighed by 
      reducing the risk of the user blithely accepting prior values that are no 
      longer appropriate. Values might be inappropriate from the user's point of 
      view even if they are valid from the system's point of view. So the 
      system's validity checking is not sufficient to warn the user about what 
      values should be reconsidered. </li></ul>
    </li><li>This recommendation is weakest if the change in sequence makes no 
    difference in the desirability of the prior values. 
    <ul>
      <li>For example, suppose the only change in a sequence 
      is elimination or injection of one step, and that that step's values have 
      no consequence for the desirability of the values in the remaining steps. 
      If the user had spent a lot of time entering those subsequent steps' 
      values in the prior traversal, the user would be inconvenienced at having 
      to reenter them.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;Clicking a<i> previous</i> 
step name that is a link in the steps list, is equivalent to clicking the 
sequence of Previous buttons in the right pane to get to that step. The same 
guidelines apply.</p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;When a previous step is 
displayed, all the subsequent step names in the steps list become unavailable 
for clicking and do not have the link appearance. This happens regardless of how 
the user gets to a&nbsp;previous step, either by clicking its name in the 
steps list or by clicking the Previous button.</p>

<p>This section supplements <a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.1">13.2.1 Basics</a> 
and <a href="13-wizards.html#13.2.2">13.2.2 
Backtracking</a>, to cover what happens when the Finish button is 
clicked.</p></div></center>
<center>
<div align="left">
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">  &nbsp;If the Finish 
button's page also has other user input controls, then when the Finish button 
is clicked first follow the guidelines above for validation checking and 
error displaying when a Next or Finish button is clicked. Only then should the wizard 
execute.&nbsp; Be sure to&nbsp;follow the guidelines below regarding the Finish 
button.</p>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;When the user clicks the Finish button, 
optionally display an alert to inform them that they are about to commit an 
action that is irreversible; for example, the deletion or reconfiguration of 
an object or objects. This alert should be displayed&nbsp;immediately after the Finish 
button is clicked but before the wizard's action is initiated. Use such an alert 
with care as&nbsp;users might become irritated if repeatedly asked to confirm 
the same actions. In some cases, inline text that informs the user of the 
impending action is sufficient but usually a JavaScript alert window is more 
appropriate. Follow the guidelines in <a href="14-alerts.html">14 Alerts and Messages</a>.</p>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;If a request for 
confirmation of the wizard's action is displayed after the Finish button is 
clicked, display the confirmation message in a self-contained secondary-content 
page, not as part of the wizard. For a wizard that is in a pop-up window the 
message should appear in a JavaScript window.</p>
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;After the Finish 
button is clicked, if a progress indicator is justified display it in the 
Results page of the wizard.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is for "synchronous" actions, for which it makes sense to leave the 
  wizard displayed while the action is being executed by the system. 
  </li><li>If instead an action will take so long that the user will be bothered by 
  the wizard remaining displayed, that is an "asynchronous" action. Asynchronous 
  actions are finished as far as the wizard is concerned, as soon as those 
  actions are successfully begun, such as jobs submitted. Subsequent progress of 
  asynchronous actions such as jobs must not be shown in the wizard, but instead 
  in a separate progress indicator. </li></ul>
<p> Non-wizards need other places to display progress indicators.&nbsp; 
But wizards have a ready-made place for progress indicators, so you should 
consider using it instead of creating another place.<br></p>
<p><img title="Required Guideline" alt="Required Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;If the wizard did not 
perfectly execute after the Finish button was clicked, then display the error 
messages in the View Results page. But:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is for "synchronous" actions, for which it makes sense to leave the wizard 
  displayed while the action is being executed by the system, so that failure 
  messages can be displayed in the View Results page. 
  </li><li>If instead an action will take so long that the user will be bothered by 
  the wizard remaining displayed, that is an "asynchronous" action. Asynchronous 
  actions succeed as far as the wizard is concerned, as long as those actions 
  are successfully begun, such as jobs successfully submitted. Subsequent 
  failure of asynchronous actions must not be shown in the wizard, but elsewhere 
  such as a separate progress indicator. </li></ul>
  
<p><img title="Advised Guideline" alt="Advised Guideline" src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" height="14" width="14">&nbsp;A given wizard within a given product should either always have a View Results 
page or never have a View Results page, regardless of that wizard's success or failure.<p></p>
