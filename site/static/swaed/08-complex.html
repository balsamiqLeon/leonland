<h1 class="style2"><a name="8"></a> 8. Complex Elements </h1>
<p class="style2">This chapter addresses the design of complex user interface elements that are 
  used in similar ways across applications. These elements are usually groups 
  of simple elements that together perform a more complex common interaction. 
  In the <a href="http://webmirror.sfbay/products/jlf/ed2/guidelines.html">Java Look and Feel Guidelines</a>, they are called<i> idioms</i>. <span class="style3"></span></p>
<p class="style14 style2">When using the user interface elements described in this chapter and elsewhere in these guidelines, remember to use them with cultural considerations in mind. For example, applications must be able to format and display time, date, and calendar data according to local cultural conventions. </p>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> To ensure that cultural considerations are addressed when using user interface controls, follow the guidelines in <a href="H-globalization.html">Appendix H, Globalization Requirements</a>. 
<P class="style19"><span class="style14"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" alt="Required Guideline" width="14" height="14" class="style12" title="Required Guideline"></span> For most elements there are these states:

<ul class="style19">
  <li>Enabled (normal) state when a value for a field is enabled </li>
  <li>Noneditable (read-only) state where a value for a field is applicable but the user cannot change it</li>
  <li>Disabled (not applicable) state when a value for a field does not apply to the current situation</li>
</ul>
<p>For fields which do not show a data value, such as the file chooser and client-side file upload, the only applicable states are enabled and disabled. The possible appearances are documented for each type of field. </p>
<P>For more information on the placement of read-only fields within a page, see <a href="06-content.html#6.8.1">6.8.1 Noneditable User Interface Elements.</a>
<P>All buttons on components should be secondary buttons.<br>

<H2 class="style19"><A name="8.1"></A> 8.1 Editable Scrolling List  </H2>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Use an editable scrolling list to manage a list of single-line text strings. 
Allow users to view the list of text strings, add new text strings, or <span class="style2">remove </span>existing text strings.</P>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> The editable scrolling list is not intended for strings which are so long as to cause horizontal scrolling on the page.</P>
<P class="style19">Here is an example with the editable scrolling list with the list below the text field (the 
  "list-on-bottom" version):</P>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="complex_graphics/editable_list_below.gif" width="570" height="175" alt="An example with the editable scrolling list below the text field (the &quot;list-on-bottom&quot; version)"></P>
<P class="style19">Here is an example of an  editable scrolling list with the list above the text field (the "list-on-top" version), with Move to Top and Move to Bottom buttons included: </P>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="complex_graphics/editable_list_above.gif" width="570" height="174" alt="An example with the editable scrolling list above the text field (the &quot;list-on-top&quot; version)"></P>
<P class="style14 style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the editable scrolling list is noneditable (read-only), the lists and buttons should be replaced with a simple list of text strings (regardless of whether the entry field was above or below when it was editable), separated by commas, some other separator character, or line breaks like this:</P>
<P class="style19"><img src="complex_graphics/editable_list_display_only.gif" alt="noneditable scrolling list examples"width="390" height="168"> </P>
<P class="style14 style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the editable scrolling list is disabled (does not apply in the current situation), its buttons, text field, and list should be disabled, like this:</P>
<P class="style19"><img src="complex_graphics/editable_list_disabled.gif" alt="disabled scrolling list example" width="584" height="179"> </P>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline">  The editable scrolling list has the following basic behavior (see the table below for more detailed button descriptions):</P>
<UL class="style19">
  <LI>To add a text string, the user types the string in the text field (or searches 
    for the string by clicking the Search... button) and then clicks the Add button.    Alternatively, when the user types the string in the text field, pressing Enter places the text into the list (as if the user had clicked the Add button).<br>
    <br>
    Note that the search capability (and the display of the Search... button) 
    is optional. If provided, it is up to the application designer to determine 
    what should be displayed to help users identify an appropriate value to be 
  passed back and displayed in the text field. </LI>
</UL>
<UL class="style19">
  <LI>To remove a text string, the user selects the string and then clicks 
    the Remove button.</LI>
</UL>
<P class="style19">The editable scrolling list differs from the <A href="08-complex.html#8.2">8.2 
  Add-and-Remove Idiom</A>. The add-and-remove idiom is used to select any number 
  of items from a list so that those items can be used for some other purpose. 
  In contrast, the editable scrolling list simply enables users to add and remove 
  items from a list of text strings.</P>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
   Use the list-on-top version or the list-on-bottom version of the editable 
  scrolling list, depending on the problem at hand.</P>
<ul class="style19">
  <li>When the user's most likely purpose is to remove list items, the list-on-top 
    version might be most appropriate.<br>
  </li>
  <li>When the user's most likely purpose is to add list items (for instance, 
  the list is empty), the list-on-bottom version might be most appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style14 style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When using the list-on-top 
version, place validation error alerts (see <a href="14-alerts.html#14.5">14.5 Validation Error Alerts</a>) for the text field *below* the editable scrolling list so it is next to the text field to which it applies. Otherwise, it will be above the list even though it applies to the text field below. </p>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> At the bottom of the list, include a line longer than the longest possible value, or a line a bit longer than the average/most common value, as makes sense for the expected values for the list. This line, which consists of a string of underscores (_), is programmatically kept below all the entries as items are added and removed. This strategy maintains a fixed line width for the list or minimizes the expansion/contraction when entries are added/removed, which keeps the geometry of the entire idiom stable. Otherwise, the buttons and list could move substantially based on the width of the remaining list items.</P>
<P class="style14 style19"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Implementation_Info.jpg" width="16" height="14" alt="Implementation Information" title="Implementation Information"> Compute the number of underscores based on both the text box's width and 
the font size of the underscores.</P>
<P class="style19"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  If the user selects the string of underscores (either by itself or with other 
  entries) and clicks any button, nothing should happen. </P>
<P class="style19"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
  Both fields must have labels for accessibility reasons. However, the labels 
  can be either left of the fields or above them. These labels should be normal font.</P>
<P class="style19"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> A label for the entire editable scrolling list is optional. If such a label is provided, place it above the editable scrolling list, left justified. This label should be bold and in larger text, like this:</P>
<P class="style19"><img src="complex_graphics/editable_list_title.gif" alt="example showing label for the entir editable scrolling list component" width="568" height="202"></P>
<P class="style19"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When having at least one value in the list is required, mark the list -- not the entire component or the entry field --to indicate that, like this:</P>
<P class="style19"><img src="complex_graphics/editable_list_required.gif" alt="example showing editable scrolling list as a required element" width="576" height="174"> </P>
<p class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> A maximum length can be set for values, and the entry field will not allow more than that number of characters to be entered. Within that maximum, the list will grow horizontally as larger values are entered. This maximum should be chosen to include all reasonable values for the situation at hand, but is helpful in keeping the buttons from scrolling off the right side of the page otherwise. </p>
<p class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> Provide Add and Remove buttons for the editable scrolling list.</p>
<P class="style19"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Advised Guideline" title="Advised Guideline"> Provide Move Up, Move Down, and optionally Move to Top and Move to Bottom buttons if it makes sense for the application. </P>
<P class="style19"><span class="style14 ">For more information on button types, see <a href="07-simple.html#7.1">7.1 Action Buttons</a>.</span></P>

        <LI>Multiple near/possible matches are found: Display a Pop-Up Browser Window a list that allows the user to select a single match from the lookup. If the user selects a match, append the selected match to the list, and reset the text box to blank.

<H3 class="style20"><A name="8.4.2" id="8.4.2"></A> 8.4.2 Scheduler Element</H3>
<P class="style20">The Scheduler element is used for setting schedules within an application. 
  This element is made up of several simple elements (labels, text fields, buttons, and 
  lists) and a calendar element. It was formerly known as the Date/Time Element. Here is an example:</P>
<P class="style20"><IMG src="complex_graphics/datetime_complex.gif" width="528" height="260" alt="Example Scheduler Element"></P>
<p class="style14 style20">The example above shows the Scheduler element as it would appear within the 
  context of a larger page. Also shown here is the legend that describes the red 
  asterisk image associated with the  Date field. This asterisk image identifies a required field, and a legend must appear in the appropriate place on the page to inform users that the field is required (see <a href="07-simple.html#7.3.2">7.3.2 
  Editable Text Fields</a> for more information). The asterisk image should appear to the right of the field labels as shown above. <br>
  <br>
Note that  Date is generally a required field. However when the Scheduler element is used on a page with other elements, there may be times when, given the context of the application, it  does not make sense to make the  Date  a required field. In this situation, the  Date  field can be made optional. This is only allowable for the inline Scheduler element. </p>
<p class="style20">An example of a situation where it would not make sense to make the  Date required might be when the user has to specify when a report gets run and it is valid to specify a particular date, or just a time that the report will be run every day.</p>
<p class="style20">In the above picture, the user can specify the date either by clicking on it 
  in the calendar or entering it into the Date field. The Preview in Calendar 
  button is available if the user enters the date into the Date field and then 
  wants to see it reflected in the calendar before clicking the OK button. The user can also use Preview in Calendar to update the calendar to 
reflect the values entered into the other applicable fields. Note that 
time information is not reflected in the calendar.</p>
<P class="style20"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
   When designing the monthly calendar for the Scheduler element, follow 
  these guidelines:</P>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>Include a set of numerical links for each day value within a given month. 
    Selecting one of the numerical hyperlinks:
    <ul>
     <li>sets the value in the  Date field to the date selected in the calendar</li>	
	  <li>refreshes the calendar to highlight the new  date and uses the information 
        in the fields adjacent to the calendar (e.g. Repeat Interval, and Repeat 
        Limit fields) to also highlight the new dates associated with the repeat 
      interval.<br>

</UL>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>Provide navigation to other months and years by allowing users to change 
    the selected values in the month and year drop-down menus at the top of the 
    calendar. Navigation by month is also accomplished by clicking the Forward 
    and Back arrow buttons on either side of the month name.</LI>
</UL>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>Adjust the layout of the calendar for other locales whose weeks start on 
    Monday, on Saturday, etc. Also, adjust the inline help text below the Start 
    Date field to indicate the proper date format for a specific locale (for example, 
    dd/mm/yyyy for the French locale).</LI>
</UL>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>Years must be displayed and specified as four digits for Y2K requirements. 
    The user, however, should be able to enter only two digits. The application 
    should convert it to specify a four-digit year internally and on the next 
    redisplay. </LI>
</UL>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>To facilitate accessibility, the numerical links within the calendar must 
    be text, not images. Each numerical link must also have the HTML Title attribute specified 
    as "[mm/dd/yyyy] (Click to Set Date)," for example, 09/28/2003 (Click to Set Date).</LI>
</UL>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>Enable users to select start and end times through the use of separate drop-down 
    menus for hours and minutes. The hour lists start at "00" and end at "23." 
    The minute lists start at "00" and end at "55," using five-minute increments. 
    Five-minute increments are used to keep the lists at a manageable size. Initial 
    values for both hours and minutes may be set to blank in situations where 
    the user must enter a specific time.</LI>
</UL>
<UL class="style20">
  <LI>When the Scheduler element first displays, the minutes and hours drop-down 
    menus should be set to blank. This value indicates that the user must set 
    an initial time. The minutes portion of the various times should always change 
    from blank to "00" as soon as an hour is set. The minutes should not change 
    if they are already set to something other than blank.<br>

Provide a Preview in Calendar button (see <a href="07-simple.html#7.1">7.1 Action Buttons</a>)  
to allow users to update the calendar to reflect the data entered in the fields.  Changes in these fields are not reflected in the calendar until the Preview in Calendar

<P class="style20"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> 
   Include simple elements (which are programmable) within the Scheduler 
  element as required for your application.</P>
<P class="style20">Various applications might only need a subset of the functionality provided 
  in the preceding example. For example, there might be a need for repeat intervals 
  but not repeat limits. Or, there might only be a need for a Start Time without 
  an End Time. To provide this flexibility, the API to this element should allow 
  for the display of a subset of simple elements. Simpler versions might include 
  the monthly calendar and Date field only for date selection or a pair 
  of drop-down menus for time selection.</P>
<P class="style20">The labels used for the time fields, Start Time and End Time, 
  should be programmable based on the application needs. The Start and End labels 
  were used as generic examples. The application developer may choose whatever 
  labels are most appropriate. </P>
<P class="style20">If a Repeat Interval is shown, the label for  date 
  might be changed to Start Date or something more specific for the date being 
  chosen.</P>
<P class="style20">The following example mimics the scheduling fields in a Solaris crontab(1) 
  file (with the exception that the crontab file does not use a year field). Such 
  files do not specify an End Time or a Repeat Limit. Users who might require 
  additional functionality unique to the cron utility would typically use the 
  actual command in a terminal window.</P>

<P class="style20">The Scheduler element can be embedded within a page, but can also be invoked in a pop-up window.<s><br>
  </s><br>
As with the Scheduler element embedded within a page, the fields displayed in the Scheduler element in a pop-up window can be displayed in full or adjusted to the needs of the application.<br>
    <br>
For example, the following picture shows a Scheduler pop-up window that could be used when the user clicks the calendar icon next to a set of fields asking for Scheduler information on a main browser page. The only fields needed are the Date and  Time fields. The user specifies the date and time and then clicks OK. </p>

<P class="style20">General guidelines for displaying a noneditable version of the Scheduler Element are to show the fields as text only. See <a href="07-simple.html#7.3.2">7.3.2 Editable Text Elements</a> for details. The calendar could appear and perhaps allow browsing months and years, but should not allow clicking on new dates. A future version of the guidelines may provide more details for this design.</P>
<H2 class="style20"><A name="8.5" id="8.5"></A> 8.5 File Selection</H2>
<p class="style20">There are two forms of file selection. Client-Side File Upload is used for selecting files on the client, while File Chooser (and Folder Chooser) are used for selecting files (or folders) on the server. Choose the appropriate one based on the location (client or 
server) from which the user will be selecting files.</p>
<H3 class="style20"><a name="8.5.1" id="8.5.1"></a> 8.5.1 Client-Side File Upload </H3>
<p class="style20"> When it is necessary to upload a file from the client to the server, the client-side file upload element can be used. The client-side file upload element is not used to browse files on the server. For this, use the file chooser element (see <a href="08-complex.html#8.5.2">8.5.2 File Chooser Element</a>). </p>
<p class="style20"> The client-side file upload element consists of a labeled text field with an associated Browse... button as shown below. The text field and label should behave like any other text field. See <a href="07-simple.html#7.3">7.3 Text Elements</a> for guidelines.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="complex_graphics/file-upload-field-button.gif" alt="Client-side File Upload Element" width="421" height="42"></p>
<p class="style20">There is no design for the client-side file selection window itself, as it is provided by the operating system, and is platform-specific.<br>
    <br>
When the Browse... button is clicked, the browser-specific client-side file chooser window is displayed. In this window, the user chooses the file to be uploaded to the server. When the user has completed making a selection in this window, the fully qualified name of the selected file is displayed in the text field of the client-side file upload element.<br>
<br>
  <img src="complex_graphics/file-upload-filled.gif" alt="A populated Client-side File Upload element" width="421" height="42"><br>
  <br>
When the page is submitted, the specified file is uploaded to the server and handled by the application. For example, the file may be opened and displayed, or it might be saved. </p>
<p class="style20">Note that the Browse... button used in this element is a standard form element. Therefore, the style of the button cannot be made to match the style of the buttons shown in other images in these guidelines. </p>
<p class="style20"><IMG src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14" alt="Required Guideline" title="Required Guideline"> When the client-side file upload is disabled (does not apply in the current situation), it should have the button and field disabled, like this:</p>
<p class="style20"><img src="complex_graphics/file-upload-disabled.gif" alt="Disabled Client-side File Upload element" width="421" height="42"></p>
<p class="style20">(There is no noneditable client-side file upload, as having a read-only version of an action would not apply.)</p>
<p class="style20">For an interactive example of Client-Side File Upload, see <a href="http://webdev2.sun.com/example/faces/chooseruploader/fileUploader.jsp">http://webdev2.sun.com/example/faces/chooseruploader/fileUploader.jsp</a></p>
<H3 class="style20"><A name="8.5.2" id="8.5.2"></A> 8.5.2 File Chooser Element</H3>
<P class="style20">The file chooser element is used to browse files on the server.  The file chooser element  is based on standard file choosers from Java and Windows 
    applications. </P>
<P class="style20">Web browsers, by default, bring up a platform-specific file selection 
      dialog that is used to browse files available to the client the browser is running 
      on. The file chooser element is not used to browse files on the client. To browse files on the client, and then upload a selected file from the client to the server, use the client-side file upload element (see <a href="08-complex.html#8.5.1">8.5.1 Client-Side File Upload  Element</a>). </P>
<P class="style14 style20">The file chooser is used to navigate through the server's file system by searching for a specific file. The list shows all folders and files within the currently selected folder.</P>
<P class="style20">The file chooser can be displayed in a pop-up window or inline on a secondary content page in the main browser window. When on a main browser page, it can appear by itself or with other user interface elements that are not specific to the file chooser, but are relevant to the page on which the file chooser is displayed.</P>
<P class="style20">Here is an example file chooser shown in a pop-up window:<br>

<H2 class="style20"><A name="8.6" id="8.6"></A> 8.6 Line Graph </H2>
<p class="style20">The line graph guidelines provide basic visual design specifications. The design elements covered here are primarily limited to font treatments, line weights, color palette, and basic layout guidelines. These designs were developed for implementation with JFreeChart, a Java class library for generating charts, although the designs should be generic enough to use with other packages.</p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> Line graphs should be displayed on a white background.</p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> Graphs should not take on the appearance of a three-dimensional display. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> Offer a graph title. The title should provide a general, yet concise, description of the graph. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14"> </strong> Provide detailed title information in a subtitle placed directly below the graph title. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> A legend should be provided with the graph. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> If presenting a duel-axis graph (two y-axis), use separate legends to describe each. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> If possible, include the title &quot;Legend:&quot; above the legend information. If including a title is not possible, provide inline help text with the legend to describe it. For guidelines on providing inline help see <a href="11-help.html#11.1">11.1 Inline Help</a>. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> The visual presentation of the legend may vary based on implementation constraints, but the final design should never visually compete with the graph itself.</p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> If the user has selected a specific scale (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), scale the graph accordingly.</p>
<p class="style20"> <strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> Space out the tick mark intervals to suit the size of the graph.</p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> Use a minimum of 10 pixels distance between the tick labels on an axis. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> If possible, provide tool tips for data points. The tool tips could contain more detailed information about the data points. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> When using time values in charts, follow the localization guidelines for time located in <a href="H-globalization.html">Appendix H - Globalization Requirements</a>.</p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> When displaying 24-hour time, add &quot;24-hour time&quot; to the axis label. </p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> </strong>To support accessibility, give the user the choice of a graph or table representation of the data. The table display could be offered via the longdesc HTML attribute in the image tag that links to a page that shows the data, or via a configuration option during the setup process for the graph. </p>

<h3 class="style20"><a name="8.6.1" id="8.6.1"></a>8.6.1 Color Palette </h3>
<p class="style20">The following palette colors are recommended for use within line charts. The palette colors have been evaluated for accessibility using Vischeck, an online tool that can emulate how a page or graphic will appear to colorblind users. The line graph colors selected mitigate the display differences. See <a href="http://vischeck.com/">http://vischeck.com/</a> for more information. Product teams can use alternate colors, as long as the colors are tested for accessibility.</p>
<p class="style20">There are two recommended color palettes, a comparative color palette and a threshold palette, which when combined provide a single palette of six colors. Using only six colors (maximum) in any given graph limits the cognitive burden of interpreting a large number of color-coded associations. It also makes distinguishing between multiple attributes and threshold lines easier for the user. </p>
<p class="style20"> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> For users to distinguish between attributes, each attribute charted should use a unique line color. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> The maximum number of attributes that can be presented on a graph at any one time is six.</p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> If you need to use alternate palette colors, <span class="style4"><span class="style1 style2">see <a href="01-introduction.html#1.4">1.4 Resources for Application Designers</a> to determine the approvals required for doing this. </span></span></p>
<h4 class="style20"><a name="8.6.1.1" id="8.6.1.1"></a>8.6.1.1 Threshold Line Colors</h4>
<p class="style20">Threshold lines can be provided on graphs to indicate alarm, status, or other thresholds. There are three colors in the threshold palette which can be used for threshold lines. See <a href="08-complex.html#8.6.2">8.6.2 Lines and Data Points</a> for more information. The three colors in the threshold palette indicate severity levels: critical (red), major (yellow/orange) and <span class="style6">minor (blue)</span>.</p>
<p class="style20"><strong><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Recommendation.jpg" width="14" height="14"></strong> Use the colors in the palette shown below for the threshold lines. </p>

<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> If a peak threshold needs to be represented in the graph, use any remaining color in the threshold or comparative palettes.</p>
<p class="style20"> <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> If thresholds need to be presented, only use one attribute per graph and black for the attribute line color as shown in the example below. </p>

<h4 class="style20"><a name="8.6.1.2" id="8.6.1.2"></a>8.6.1.2 Comparative Attribute Line Colors </h4>
<p class="style20">The comparative palette colors are primarily used in graphs that present multiple attribute lines. When graphs present multiple attributes, unique colors for each attribute line helps the user distinguish between them.</p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> Graphs with multiple attributes should not include threshold lines. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> When threshold lines are not included in the graph, the comparative palette can be extended with colors from the &quot;threshold&quot; palette. </p>

<h2 class="style20"><a name="8.7" id="8.7"></a>8.7 Portal Elements </h2>
<p class="style20">This section provides design specifications for user interface elements that are used within <span class="style2">Sun-branded portal pages</span>.<span class="style2"> A  definition of a portlet is given, and the portlet table and portlet tab components are discussed.</span> Basic page layout suggestions for presentation of a portlet within a Web page are also presented. Navigation or technical considerations of portal site design are not discussed. </p>
<p class="style20">The <span class="style2">portlet table and portlet tab </span> elements described here are based on the <span class="style2">components in the Sun Common UI Component Library (in open source, the Project Woodstock components)</span>, but <span class="style9"><span class="style2">shown with a visual treatment</span></span> specifically for use in the portlet environment.</p>
<h3 class="style20"><a name="8.7.1" id="8.7.1"></a>8.7.1 Portlet Definition </h3>
<p class="style20">Portlets are Java-based Web constructs, managed by a portlet container, which offer aggregated, customized, and dynamic content. They are presented on a Web portal page containing one or many portlets. For more information refer to the <span class="style17"><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2003/jw-0801-portlet.html">JSR (Java Specification Request) 168 Portlet Specification</a>.</font></span> </p>
<p class="style20">This portlet user interface design is comprised of the portlet content area and a title bar. The title bar contains the portlet title and the portlet controls.</p>
<p class="style20"><img src="complex_graphics/portlet.png" alt="Basic portlet" width="888" height="506"></p>
<h4 class="style20"><a name="8.7.1.1" id="8.7.1.1"></a>8.7.1.1 Title Bar Controls </h4>
<p class="style20">A close button is provided in the far right corner to close that portlet.</p>
<p class="style20">Portlets also offer action controls which act on the level of the portlet. The controls are initiated through an Edit drop-down menu. This menu is placed at the top right, left only of the close control.</p>
<p class="style20">The drop-down menu generally contains items that allow users to modify the portlet's view and content. Some examples include collapsing or hiding the portlet container, changing its position on a page, or setting preferences for what is to be shown in the portlet. </p>
<p class="style20">An additional drop-down menu item may launch a &quot;Help&quot; window page as a secondary window. For guidelines regarding secondary windows, refer to section <a href="03-windows-pages.html#3.8">3.8 Secondary Content Pages</a>. Development teams may also want to include application-specific buttons. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="complex_graphics/drop_down.png" alt="Portlet drop down" width="792" height="444"><br>
    <br>
    <img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> The Edit drop-down menu remains open until the user makes a menu selection or clicks the drop-down toggle button to dismiss the menu.</p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> Edit Drop-down menu selections should be visually indicated by highlighting the selected item, or by using a checkmark icon. Use the same highlight color chosen for other areas within the application. The highlight selection color should be consistent throughout the user interface.</p>
<p class="style20">Regardless of functionality, both controls use the same visual characteristics to indicate three different action states: default (not pressed), hover, and pressed. See the examples below: </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="complex_graphics/button_states.png" alt="Portlet title bar controls in default, hover, and default states. Also shows top alignment even when title bar height increases." width="500" height="349"></p>
<h4 class="style20"><a name="8.7.1.2" id="8.7.1.2"></a>8.7.1.2 Content Area </h4>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> Portlet content area should have a white background color, unless a portlet is used for login. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> The border for the content area should be a 1-pixel gray line. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> 
If a portlet is used for user login, use <span class="style2">a  background gradient as shown in the following section, </span> to emphasize and distinguish it from other portlets on the page.</p>
<p class="style20">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="style20"><a name="8.7.1.3" id="8.7.1.3"></a>8.7.1.3 Page Layout </h4>
<p class="style20">As an initial configuration, portlets are typically combined within a Web portal page. Users can most often tailor portlet configuration and content from this presentation. Consistent spacing between portlets will help to maintain a usable page design, despite changes to the portlet configurations. The recommended spacing between portlets is illustrated below. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="complex_graphics/portal_layout.png" alt="Page layout example" width="867" height="765"></p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> Portlets should be spaced 20 pixels apart from one another, and other components, when combined on a Web portal page together. </p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> Like other page elements, portlets should also maintain the 10-pixel margin for the page edge.</p>
<p class="style20"><img src="Guidelines_Icons/Requirement.jpg" width="14" height="14"> If a specific portlet needs to be emphasized on the page, place it in the upper left-hand corner of the content area. </p>
<h3 class="style20"><a name="8.7.2" id="8.7.2"></a>8.7.2 Portlet Table </h3>
<p class="style20">The portlet table is used within the content area of a portlet. The table design for a portlet is a modified version of the Sun <span class="style2"> Common UI</span> Component Library <span class="style2"> (in open source, the Project Woodstock components)</span> table design. It offers all of the same functionality as the <s></s>Sun <span class="style2">Common UI </span> Component Library, yet has a different visual treatment for presentation within a portlet window. </p>
<p class="style20">The portlet table is distinguished from the standard table by its visually diminished table title and title bar background, no table background element, and different visual treatment for the table action bar and column headers. These combined&nbsp; differences allow the portlet table to exist within the portlet without visually overwhelming it and distracting the user from the data inside.</p>
<p class="style20">While the portlet table offers the same functionality as the standard Sun <span class="style2">Common UI </span> Component Library <span class="style2">(in open source, the Project Woodstock components)</span> table, you should avoid employing full table functionality in a portlet environment. Full table functionality, with its visual affordances, can easily overwhelm the condensed portlet display and make it difficult for users to find information. </p>
<p class="style20">The ideal presentation of the portlet table is a property table or a table with only a few actions. If the tabular data needs more robust table functionality, you should redirect users to another Web page containing a standard table display. </p>
<p class="style18"><img src="complex_graphics/table_lite_prop.png" alt="Portlet table (property page view)" width="649" height="208"></p>
<p class="style18"><img src="complex_graphics/table_lite_action.png" alt="Portlet table (with action bar)" width="882" height="250"></p>

<h3 class="style20"><a name="8.7.3" id="8.7.3"></a>8.7.3 Portlet Mini-Tab Group </h3>
<p class="style20">The portlet mini-tab group is used within the content area of a portlet. The mini-tab group is a modified version of the Sun Common UI Component Library (in open source, the Project Woodstock components) tab component design. The portal tabs can only have one level of tabs, as opposed to the standard tab design which can have up to three levels. The portlet tab design offers a simple means of switching views between a few tabbed content panes. It is visually distinct from the standard Sun Common UI Component Library tab design because background shading behind the tabs is absent and a containment box encloses the tabbed pane. See the example below: </p>
