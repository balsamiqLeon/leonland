<h3><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>This is sample HTML for the file and folder chooser tag specified in <a href="../../08-complex.html#8.5.2">8.5.2 File Chooser Element</a>.
  There are two variations of this general design covered in the guidelines,
  one that allows users to choose files and one that allows them to choose folders.
In terms of appearance, the differences between the two are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the label on the main action button on the bottom will either be &quot;Choose
    File&quot; or &quot;Choose Folder&quot;</li>
  <li>the title tag for the button will either be &quot;Choose File and Exit
    File Chooser&quot; or &quot;Choose Folder and Exit Folder Chooser&quot;</li>
  <li>the validation and error messages will also vary somewhat (see release
    notes below for details)</li>
  <li>file names are disabled in the list box in the choose folder version (not
    supported by IE)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also variations based on the number of items the File/Folder Chooser 
  is supposed to return. If a single item is to be returned, which would be the 
  default behavior of the tag, the list box containing the file and folder names 
  should only accept single selections (i.e., there is no &quot;multiple&quot; 
  attribute in the select tag). If multiple items can be returned, the list box 
  should be able to accept multiple selections via the addition of a &quot;multiple&quot; 
  attribute to the select tag, and an embedded help text string is added beneath 
  the box stating: &quot;<span class="HlpFldTxt">To select multiple items use 
  Shift-click or Ctrl-click</span>.&quot;</p>
<p>See the release notes below for more implementation details on the Choose
  Folder  variation. See <a href="../../08-complex.html#8.5.2">8.5.2 File Chooser Element</a>
  for additional information.</p>

<h3><a name="notes" id="notes"></a>Release Notes</h3>
<p>The button tag now supports the ability to dynamically enable and disable buttons 
  on Netscape 6/7/Mozilla and on Internet Explorer. The File/Folder Chooser should 
  take advantage of this capability (although the javascript required for this 
  behavior has not been included in the sample HTML provided):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Folder button - this button should be enabled only when a single folder 
    has been selected in the list. <br />
    <ul>
      <li>If a file is selected, then the button should be disabled. On Netscape 
        7, individual &lt;option&gt;'s containing file names can be declared as 
        disabled and therefore are not selectable, so disabling the button will 
      be redundant (see note below).</li>
      <li>If more than one folder is selected in the multiple select condition, 
            then the button should be disabled. 
Choose File button - this button should be enabled only when there is a 
    file selected in the list, or when the user has entered a value into the Selected 
  File field, otherwise it should be disabled.
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Choose Folder button - this button should be enabled only when there is 
      a folder (not a file) selected in the list, or when the user has entered a 
      value into the Selected Folder field, otherwise it should be disabled. 
<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, in the case of the Folder Chooser, because files are not valid objects
   to be selected, the &lt;option&gt; tag for file items, in addition to having
    the LstOptDis style, should specify a &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Netscape
     6/7/Mozilla supports disabling individual &lt;option&gt;s within a &lt;select&gt; 
  and this will prevent users from being able to highlight files. Currently,
  Internet  Explorer does not support this capability, though is likely to (it's
  part of 
  HTML 4),  so the client-side validation described
   above will still have to be run when the user selects a file in the list in
  
  these latter browsers. The simplest strategy is to have a single HTML/javascript
   code base for all browsers, including calls to client-side validation (e.g.,
  
  in the onClick events for the buttons) --because NS6+ and IE will ignore these
   onClick events when the button is declared as disabled, users of these browsers
  
  won't have to see the javascript alerts. In this sense, the javascript alerts
   are safety mechanisms for users of dated browsers.</p>
<p>When the file/folder chooser appears in a secondary window, it should have 
  a secondary masthead containing the particular application's name. </p>
