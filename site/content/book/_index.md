# Wireframing for Everyone

by Michael Angeles, Leon Barnard, and Billy Carlson

**Coming June, 2023. [Pre-order now from A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/wireframing-for-everyone)**

*[Wireframing for Everyone](https://balsamiq.com/learn/wireframing-book/)* is product design book written for anyone wanting to learn how to turn an idea into reality.

See how wireframes and low-fidelity design can help teams work more effectively and learn how to design and communicate better by focusing on structure instead of pixels.

Building on our decades of combined experience throughout this book we demonstrate the power of low-fidelity design to involve everyone in the design process to build better products.

This broad approach also demystifies UI design through the lens of wireframing, by stripping away the decorative layer so that anyone can learn to construct a digital product and make it easy to use.
