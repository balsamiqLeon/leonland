# Wireframing for Everyone

*[Wireframing for Everyone](https://balsamiq.com/learn/wireframing-book/)* is product design book written for anyone wanting to learn how to turn an idea into reality.

See how wireframes and low-fidelity design can **help teams work more effectively** and learn how to **design and communicate better** by focusing on structure instead of pixels.

Building on our decades of combined experience throughout this book we demonstrate the **power of low-fidelity design to involve everyone in the design process** to build better products.

This broad approach also **demystifies UI design** through the lens of wireframing, by stripping away the decorative layer so that **anyone can learn to construct a digital product** and make it easy to use.

### Topics covered

* The role of wireframes in software development
* Wireframing techniques for generating design concepts
* Using wireframes for cross-functional participation
* User interface design basics
* Presenting and getting feedback on your wireframes
* Following your ideas through to implementation
