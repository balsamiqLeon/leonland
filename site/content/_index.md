I'm **Leon**, a dad, husband, and User Experience specialist. I work at [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/), maker of the best little wireframing tool around. I help people and technology get along better.

Perhaps you'd like to find out **[what I do for work](/work/)**, like [write](/work/#writing) and [speak](/work/#speaking) about UX design, web technologies, remote work, and more.

Or maybe you'd like to learn about my **[fun side projects](/fun/)**, like making random websites and [DJ mixtapes](/dj/).

If else, you might just want to [contact me](/contact/).
