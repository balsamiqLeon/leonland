title: "Leon Barnard has a website"

I'm **Leon**, a dad, husband, and writer/designer. I work at [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/), maker of the best little wireframing tool around. I help people and technology get along better.

Perhaps you'd like to find out **[what I do for work](/work/#top)**, like [write](/work/#writing) and [speak](/work/#speaking) about User Experience design and documentation, among other things.

Or maybe you'd like to learn about my **[fun side projects](/fun/#top)**, like making random websites and my recent DJ hobby.

If else, you might just want to [contact me](/contact/#top).
