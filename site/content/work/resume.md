The unifying theme throughout my career has been helping people and technology get along better. First as a UX designer for nearly 10 years and now as a hybrid Writer / Educator / Designer at Balsamiq.  I write about my experiences as a UX designer for our education site ([balsamiq.com/learn](https://balsamiq.com/learn/)), which I also design and develop. I am also interested in front-end web development and remote working.
